# SCQO — Superconducting Qubit Orchestration (instrument-agnostic)

## Why this repo exists
Run superconducting-qubit calibration experiments at the level of **experiment + parameters**, independent of
the instrument backend. Two existing lab repos do the same physics on different hardware; SCQO is the
neutral layer above them, and the substrate for **AI-driven experiment loops** (decide approach + params →
run → estimate → extract → decide next).

## Terminology (canonical vocabulary — single source of truth)
The word **"protocol" is retired**; use these names across all repos.

- **Experiment** — the registered, instrument-agnostic unit SCQO catalogs and dispatches to a backend (QM or Qblox). Owns its **Parameters**; binds a probe + **exactly one** estimator.
- **probe** — the acquisition half: build the instrument sequence (QM program / Qblox schedule) and run it → **Dataset** (xarray). On the simulated backend the probe runs the **model** forward to synthesize data ("simulation = virtual experiment").
- **estimator** — the analysis half: fit the Dataset to a **model** → **Result** (extracted model parameters). Implemented in scqat (`scqat.estimators`); its orchestrator method is `analyze()`. Keyed by a **reading** — a dataset shape AND the model fitted to it — and bound by exactly ONE experiment (see *The estimator binding*).
- **tool** / **fitter** — reusable helpers an estimator imports (`scqat.tools`); a fitter is the common case. Many-to-many; **tools never import estimators**.
- **model** — the physics that predicts the signal; used *forward* by a simulated probe and *inverse* by an estimator. SCQ.jl builds/simulates models; scqat fits them.
- **Parameters / Result / Backend / Session** — input schema / extracted output / instrument adapter (QM, Qblox, Simulated) / the orchestrator entry point (`catalog()` / `run()` / `device_state()`).
- **campaign** — an ordered list of experiment STEPS walked N times (`CampaignPlan` / `Session.run_campaign()` / `campaign_id`). OUTER repetition: every (repeat, step) is a full `run()` with its own folder, dataset, fit and TIMESTAMP, stamped `campaign`/`repeat_idx`/`step_idx`; the campaign owns only the plan, the cadence, the stop conditions and the per-(experiment, target, quantity) statistics. Repeating ONE experiment is the degenerate 1-step case. Do NOT call it a *repetition* (scqat's `repetition_data` splitter, the drivers' HW-averaging loop and `pulse_repetitions` already own that word) nor a *series* (the /trends time series).

The scqo stack uses this vocabulary throughout — **scqat** (`estimators/`, `tools/`, `BaseEstimator`), **SCQO** (`Experiment`, `scqo.experiments`, `probe()`, `estimate()`), and the drivers **scqo-qblox** + **scqo-qm** (`probe()`-only experiments). scqat's estimator keeps its own orchestrator method `analyze()` (a different layer). scqo-qm's vendored official qualibrate nodes keep qualibrate's own `node` framework and never import scqo (its scqo surface is the `scqo_qm` package). (QBLOX_training documents Qblox's *own* `Experiment` ABC — a different class from this `Experiment`.)

### The estimator binding (1:1, in both directions)

An **Experiment** binds exactly one estimator, and an estimator is bound by exactly one
experiment. Four layers, four independent keys:

| Layer | Keyed by | Changes when |
|---|---|---|
| `probe()` | the instrument sequence | the pulses change |
| `DatasetContract` | dims + variables + `target_kinds` | the SHAPE of what comes back changes |
| **estimator** (scqat) | (contract, **model**) — a READING | the MATH changes |
| `estimate()` / `update()` | question + writeback — an INTENT | the QUESTION changes |

A binding is a claim that THIS model describes THIS signal. Two experiments binding one
estimator therefore assert the same physics — and if they really do, they are one
experiment. Share math through `scqat.tools` and presentation through a `_`-prefixed module
under `scqat/estimators/`; never through a second binding.

**Two things that look like evidence for sharing and are not:**

1. **A contract is a shape check, never a semantic one.** `DatasetContract.validate()`
   checks dims, coordinate names and variables; it asserts nothing about meaning.
   `qubit_spectroscopy` and `resonator_spectroscopy` both declare
   `sweeps=("detuning_hz",), sweep_units=("Hz",), variables=("I","Q")` — and even the axis
   NAME agrees while the frame differs, because `DETUNING_AXIS` is shared by both detuning
   mixins and the frame lives in the Parameters field names (`start_drive_detuning_hz` vs
   `start_readout_detuning_hz`). Likewise `qubit_echo_flux_pulse` and
   `qubit_relaxation_flux_pulse` share `("flux_bias_v","wait_time_ns")` byte-for-byte and
   correctly have their own estimators.
2. **A shared fit routine is never a shared model.** `qubit_spectroscopy`'s line under
   `readout_overlap=true` is AC-Stark shifted by the live readout tone — different physics —
   and one Lorentzian fits both modes only because a shifted Lorentzian is still a
   Lorentzian. That used to be a SECOND experiment (`qubit_spectroscopy_overlap`) reusing
   this one's estimator, which bound a physics claim to a numerical coincidence. It was
   resolved by rule 4 below, not by keeping the second binding: the two are one experiment
   with a Parameters field selecting the sequence, so one estimator serves them honestly.

**Deciding, first match wins:**

0. Do the axes MEAN the same thing — not "are they spelled the same"? If not: two
   experiments, two estimators, however identical the contracts look.
1. Does the SHAPE differ (dims / variables / units / `target_kinds`)? → two experiments,
   two estimators; share the probe in a driver `_module.py` and the math in `scqat.tools`.
   Injecting an axis name into a shared estimator base class is the anti-pattern here.
2. Same shape and meaning, different math, SAME quantities? → ONE experiment, multi-method
   `method=` strategies (scqat's CLAUDE.md → *Multi-method estimators*).
3. Same shape and meaning, different math, DIFFERENT quantities? → two experiments, two
   estimators over a shared `tools/` reduction.
4. Same shape, meaning AND model, different question or writeback? → ONE experiment, with a
   Parameters field selecting the question; a value a backend cannot realize is REFUSED BY
   NAME, as `reset_method` already does. If the two genuinely cannot be one experiment —
   incompatible `target_kinds`, `required_operations`, `run()` structure or writeback — then
   the reading differs after all and each gets its own estimator.

The tree does not yet conform. The generated map under *The registered experiments* marks
every shared binding, and `tests/test_one_estimator_per_experiment.py` carries them with
each one's migration. That list may only shrink.

## Where the two backends started (historical)

**This section is history, not the current picture** — for the repos as they are today see
**Reference backends** near the end. SCQO was extracted from two lab drivers that did the same
physics on different hardware: `LCHQMDriver`, now **[scqo-qm](https://github.com/shiau109/scqo-qm)**,
and `LCHQBDriver`, now **[scqo-qblox](https://github.com/shiau109/scqo-qblox)**. Neither old name
exists any more. The Qblox column below is drawn from `QBLOX_training`, the read-only vendor
example repo the Qblox driver was written against — it is a *reference*, not an ancestor, and it
documents Qblox's own `Experiment` ABC, a different class from this one.

| | QM side (was LCHQMDriver) | Qblox side (QBLOX_training reference) |
|---|---|---|
| Instrument | Quantum Machines OPX1000 (MW-FEM + LF-FEM) | Qblox Cluster (QCM / QCM-RF / QRM-RF) |
| Low-level API | `qm-qua` (QUA DSL) | `qblox_scheduler` (`Schedule` + `Operations`) |
| Device model | QUAM — `Quam(FluxTunableQuam)`; qubit = `.xy/.z/.resonator`; param e.g. `q.f_01` | `QuantumDevice` + `BasicTransmonElement`/`FluxTunableTransmonElement`; param e.g. `q.clock_freqs.f01` |
| Experiment framework | `qualibrate` `QualibrationNode` + `@node.run_action` + web GUI | hand-rolled `Experiment` ABC, notebook-driven, no GUI |
| Parameters | `NodeParameters` (pydantic, mixin inheritance, validated) | positional kwargs to `execute(...)`, no schema |
| Pulse DSL | `qubit.xy.play("x180")` (QUAM macros) | `X(qubit)`, `Measure(...)` (scheduler operations) |
| Sweep | QUA `for_` loops, xarray `sweep_axes` | `Schedule.loop(linspace/arange)` |
| Data out | `XarrayDataFetcher` → `xarray.Dataset` | `hw_agent.run()` → `xarray.Dataset` |
| State writeback | `node.record_state_updates(): q.f_01 -= …` | `post_run(): q.clock_freqs.readout = fr` |
| Persistence | `quam_state/*.json` | `dut_config_*.json` |

### What already converges (build on these)
- Both emit an **`xarray.Dataset`** as the canonical data format.
- Both split **experiment parameters** (the sweep) from **device state** (qubit config persisted to JSON).
- Both follow the same lifecycle: **build sweep → run on HW → analyze/fit → write results back to device → persist.**

### Where they diverge (what the neutral layer must absorb)
1. Parameter declaration: rich pydantic schema vs bare kwargs.
2. Experiment framework: real framework + GUI vs thin ABC.
3. Pulse/sweep DSL: QUAM macros vs scheduler operations.
4. Device-model attribute names: `q.f_01` / `q.xy.RF_frequency` vs `q.clock_freqs.f01` / `q.clock_freqs.readout`.

## Target architecture (AI-drivable, backend-neutral)
Adopt qualibrate's *patterns*, generalized so QM and Qblox are adapters:

- **Parameters**: pydantic schema per experiment (introspectable: names, types, ranges, defaults, docstrings).
- **Experiment registry**: named, described catalog of measurement approaches (the AI's decision menu).
- **Experiment lifecycle**: `probe → run → estimate → update` (neutral; a driver implements `probe`, the backend runs it).
- **Structured Result + Outcome**: machine-readable extracted quantities + success flags (not just figures).
- **Device model adapter**: neutral parameter names mapped onto QUAM vs QuantumDevice attributes.
- **State + history**: persistent device state and run history so an AI loop has memory.

AI loop surface:
`registry + Parameters schema (decide)` → backend adapter (run) → `structured Result (extract)` →
device-state update + history → next decision.

## Package layout

The device model is the greenfield schema — `docs/greenfield-schema.md` is the spec
(marked implemented). A device = MODES (quantum degrees of freedom), COMPOSITES (named
mode groups with joint physics), LINES (physical control paths) and CHANNELS (one signal
of one kind riding a line); a line's rider lists mint the channels. Field routing is
per-field by ROLE: fact -> physical.json, knob -> scqo_state.json + pushed to the vendor,
monitor -> scqo_state.json never pushed. Knobs live on CHANNELS (`q1_ro.readout_freq_hz`,
`q1_xy.pi_amp`, `q1_xy.thermalization_time_s`, `q1_z.idle_flux`); facts live on modes and composites (`q1.f_01_hz`,
`q1_res.f_dress0_hz`, `q1_q2.zz_hz`); composite per-operation knobs are full names
(`iswap_coupler_flux`). As-designed targets live in the sibling `design.toml`.

### Which estimator each experiment binds

<!-- BEGIN generated: estimator-map -->
**GENERATED** - refresh with `python scripts/update_docs.py`. Which scqat estimator
each experiment binds, resolved through the MRO (so an inherited `estimate()` is
attributed to the estimator it actually runs). The rule is ONE estimator per
experiment and ONE experiment per estimator - see **Terminology**. A row naming two
experiments, or a name in the trailing line, is a KNOWN VIOLATION carried in
`tests/test_one_estimator_per_experiment.py`; that list may only shrink.

### Datastore (the "find my measurement data" layer)
`Session(backend, data_root=...)` persists **every** run — raw dataset (`dataset.nc`),
parameters/result/record JSONs, device before/after snapshots, and the scqat artifacts
(metadata / plotdata / figure PNGs, per qubit) — under
`<data_root>/<device>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<run_id>/`. The **run folder is the truth**;
`<data_root>/index.sqlite` is a disposable cache (`python -m scqo <data_root>`
rebuilds it). Query with `Session.find_runs(experiment=, target=, tag=, since=, outcome=,...)`,
reload with `load_run(run_id)` / `datastore.open_dataset(run_id)`. A **campaign**
persists one extra folder, `<data_root>/<device>/campaigns/<campaign_id>/`
(`campaign.json` = plan + status + statistics + the aggregate SUGGESTIONS and their
decisions, rewritten per repeat; `repeats.jsonl` = append-only skeleton, run_ids and
timing, never fit VALUES) — a sibling of the day folders because an overnight campaign
crosses midnight, and invisible to every glob over the data root. Post-finalize
decisions go ONLY through the locked `edit_campaign_suggestions` (persist_campaign is
the running process's lockless whole-file write); the campaigns table carries a
derived `suggestions_pending` column (schema v10) behind `find_campaigns(pending=)`,
and applied values stamp `ChangeRecord.campaign_id` (provenance status "campaign";
decide via `scqo accept --campaign <id>`, regenerate pre-feature campaigns via
`scqo campaign --suggest <id>`). Its children are ordinary runs stamped `campaign`/`repeat_idx`/`step_idx`
in an INDEXED column (never a `campaign:<id>` tag — that would be an unindexed
`json_each` scan and a second grouping authority); walk them with
`campaign_runs(campaign_id)`, which is unlimited and in execution order, NOT
`find_runs(campaign=...)`, which is newest-first and capped at 50.
The manifest is finalized in a `finally`, so it is written on EVERY exit path -
normal stop, Ctrl-C anywhere (including the cadence sleep, which is where a
`period_s` campaign spends most of its wall clock), or an unexpected error
(`status="failed"`). An interrupted repeat KEEPS the steps that already ran, marked
`partial` and counted in `repeats_partial`, never in `repeat_done` - the data is
already on disk and campaign-stamped, so discarding it would leave `campaign_runs()`
returning more children than the manifest admits. `run_campaign` never prints - it
emits `cadence_wait`/`repeat_start`/`step_done`/`repeat_done` to an `on_progress`
callback and the CLI renders (`cli/_campaign.py::progress_lines`), and
`cli/_campaign_plot.py` writes `statistics.png` into the campaign folder on finalize
(lazy Agg matplotlib; a figure failure warns and NEVER fails the campaign). Those lines go to **stderr**, `#`-prefixed,
ASCII, plain newlines and **never `\r`**: stdout must stay `| jq`-parseable, and on
QM the vendor's `progress_counter` already rewrites a bar there. `"stop"` from the
callback is honoured only at `repeat_done` — stopping mid-repeat would leave a
half-walked bundle whose quantities no longer share a drift epoch. Runs carry searchable
**tags** (`run(..., tags=[...])`, config `default_tags`, retroactive `tag_run`). Change
history records the `run_id` that caused each device update. State authority:
`state_sync="pull"` (default) seeds from the vendor at startup (safe when another tool also
calibrates, e.g. qualibrate on QM); `"push"` restores the saved SCQO config into the vendor
and is TEMPORARILY refused for every hardware backend (`make_session`, keyed on
`backend_label != "simulated"`): a push seeds the vendor from `scqo_state.json` with no
history rows and would clobber hand edits of the vendor config. Only the built-in simulated
backend runs push (forced); `load_lab_config` refuses any value outside pull|push.

**Multi-device rule:** the device = the physical SAMPLE (chip),
never the instrument; the instrument is provenance (every run/fit stamps `backend`).
ONE data_root + ONE index for all samples (`find_runs(device=...)` / `--device` filter;
per-sample DBs are rejected). Each user selects the sample and setup (`device`/`setup`
in user.toml; `scqo user`); which instrument carries it — and where its vendor config
folder lives — is a fact of the SELECTED named setup of the device's ACTIVE cooldown
cycle (`[<cycle>.setup.<name>]` in its cooldowns.toml), never a config key. ALL folder
locations are DERIVED from the registry keys: a setup table is exactly `backend` +
optional `note`; its vendor folder is the sibling `<cid>/<name>/backend_config/`,
injected by `load_cooldowns` as `setup["instrument_config"]` (typed paths are refused —
they can dangle). That sibling split is load-bearing: it keeps SCQO's own files out of
QUAM's state-directory rglob by construction.
Instrument-independent sample facts live in the optional human-edited registry
`<data_root>/devices.toml` (`datastore.load_device_registry`; rendered by the viewer).
Instrument-DEPENDENT measured values (thermal population etc.) stay in run records with
backend provenance — compare across instruments by query, never average them away.
Sample-level inferred physics (`sample.json` per device folder) is Phase-3 output.
Moving a sample between instruments needs NO data action (folder/history/trends follow
the sample; eras distinguish by backend) — procedure in INSTALL.md §2. Rule: qubit
names belong to the SAMPLE and must be identical in every vendor config ("q1" = the
same physical qubit on both instruments), or its trends and history split.
Scale/concurrency (tests/test_index_scale.py): device-scoped pages are O(limit) via
the composite index — fast at 100k+ runs/sample, unaffected by neighbors; only
UNSCOPED JSON tag/qubit filters scan lab-wide totals. Simultaneous same-PC sessions
(two students, two samples) are safe (WAL + busy retry; folder written before index,
so reindex heals any skipped write); multi-PC writers need per-PC data_roots.

### How a driver adds an experiment
1. Subclass the backend-free experiment from `scqo.experiments`.
2. Implement only `probe()` for the instrument (lazy-import the vendor lib inside it).
3. `@register` the subclass so it appears in `catalog()`.
Parameters, Result, `estimate`, `simulate` and `update` are inherited unchanged.

### Backend parity — the two probes must realize the SAME sequence
Given one Parameters object, both drivers' `probe()` must produce the same
experiment: the same pulse ORDER, the same pulses PRESENT, and the same tones ON
during acquisition. Only vendor idiom may differ — QM's `align()` / `wait()`
against Qblox's ASAP chaining and `rel_time`, a rendered waveform against a
stitched AWG-offset pair. Timing that both sides need is derived ONCE in a shared
neutral helper (`_overlap.overlap_windows`, `_capabilities.qubit_reset.reset_wait_ns`,
`_depletion.depletion_wait_ns`) and the probes only spend the numbers.

**A field description saying some backend "ignores" a parameter is this rule's
counter-example, not an exemption.** `drive_len_ns` carried exactly that sentence
while QM played a finite saturation pulse and Qblox latched a continuous one
across the whole sweep — so `scqo run qubit_spectroscopy` measured the bare
line on one instrument and an AC-Stark-shifted one on the other, and both wrote
the result into the same `drive_freq_hz`. Fixed 2026-09-03.

The exception is an OPTIONAL CAPABILITY a backend cannot realize — which
`reset_method` opt-in sets a driver carries, or an experiment that only ships on
one side. Those are legitimately asymmetric (`_capabilities/qubit_reset.py` says
so, and each driver's census test is the authority), but the backend must REFUSE
BY NAME and never silently downgrade. Each driver pins the sequence half with a
structural test over its own compiled output (`test_sequential_timing.py` on
Qblox, `test_sequential_probe.py` on QM).

### Testing discipline — run only what the edit can break
Default for a localized change (from the repo root): `uv run pytest tests/test_model_experiments.py -k ramsey -q`.
Selection map for experiment work (`scqo/experiments/<name>.py`) — always the first row, plus any that apply:

| Also changed | Add to the run |
|---|---|
| *always* | `tests/test_model_experiments.py -k <stem>` |
| a capability mixin (`_capabilities/`) | `tests/test_capabilities.py` **+ `tests/test_model_experiments.py` UNFILTERED** — drop the `-k`: a mixin edit is shared-core for every experiment that subclasses it, and only the full every-experiment sweep catches the ones you didn't think of |
| a time axis (`idle_time_ns`-style grid) | `tests/test_time_grid.py -k <stem>` |
| `Contract` / `define_sweep` | `tests/test_contract.py` (small — run whole) |
| a `*_method` Literal | `tests/test_estimator_method_sync.py` |
| a `catalog.py` FieldSpec | `tests/test_model_catalog.py` |
| Parameters defaults/overlay plumbing | `tests/test_parameter_defaults.py` |
| `campaign.py` / `run_campaign` / the campaign CLI | `tests/test_campaign.py` + `tests/test_cli_campaign.py` |
| `report.py`'s catalog-derived field orders | **+ `tests/test_viewer.py`** — the viewer imports them |

`-k` takes the **distinctive stem, not the registered name**: `-k ramsey` matches both
`test_every_experiment_runs_clean[qubit_ramsey]` and `test_ramsey_writes_drive_freq_fact_twin_and_t2`,
while `-k qubit_ramsey` misses the second. **0 collected means the filter was wrong** — widen it, never skip.
Leave `test_cli_*.py` (many subprocess spawns), `test_index_scale.py` (100k rows) and `test_viewer.py` alone
unless the edit is in `scqo/cli/`, `scqo/datastore.py` or `scqo/viewer/` respectively.

The **full suite** (`uv run pytest -q`) takes minutes, dominated by the `test_cli_*.py` subprocess
tests. It is for exactly two cases: (1) cutting a release, and (2) an edit to **shared core**, which
means one of `catalog.py`, `entities.py`, `roster.py`, `stores.py`, `device.py`, `experiment.py`,
`session.py` — **or a `_capabilities/` mixin**, whose blast radius is every experiment that
subclasses it (the row above says so; this list is the same claim, not a narrower one).
Otherwise **report the exact command run** and offer the full-suite command instead of spending the
minutes unasked.

No test or timing counts are quoted here on purpose: they rotted two releases deep last time
(771 was the v2.1.0 number, still printed at v3.1.0 when the real figure was 868). Each release
records the per-repo counts it actually validated — see the `OFFLINE-VALIDATED` line in the
matching [RELEASES.toml](RELEASES.toml) block.

### Experiment governance + promotion checklist
Three roles, distinguished by ACCESS rather than seniority:

1. **Operators** use the `scqo` command (`scqo run` / `scqo find` / `scqo user`) with
   `~/.scqo/config.toml`; they change nothing in these repos.
2. **Contributors** prototype a new experiment + estimator **in a fork** and open pull
   requests back — [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the layout, the branch/merge
   order across repos, and what a PR must prove. (The `scqo-contrib` sandbox that used to
   be this tier is **retired**: it is private, pinned at v0.12.0, excluded from every combo
   since greenfield, and its template imports a `QubitSelection` that greenfield renamed to
   `TargetSelection` — so it fails on import and cannot even be copied from. Do not route
   anyone there.)
3. **A maintainer merges** the promotion — someone with push rights on these repos, which on
   a fork PR means the reviewer. Checklist, which is also what a PR is reviewed against:
   - [ ] `DatasetContract` declared; probe output validated against it on the real instrument.
   - [ ] `simulate()` implemented -> offline end-to-end test in `tests/`.
   - [ ] Estimator lives in scqat with metadata (+ figures) outputs, and is bound by
         THIS experiment only. If an existing estimator looks like it fits, work the
         decision procedure in *The estimator binding* — the answer is a merge or a
         `tools/` reduction, never a second binding.
   - [ ] `update()` writes only catalogued fields (extend the kind catalog in `catalog.py` first if needed).
   - [ ] Ran repeatedly with findable data; results reviewed via `find_runs`. State plainly
         whether that was on hardware or offline — a PR records this as
         `offline` / `hardware <chip> <date>` / `unverified`.
   - [ ] `description` is catalog-quality (an AI reads it to decide).
   - [ ] Physics half in `scqo/experiments/`; driver `probe()` subclasses registered under
         the core `scqo.experiments` group (then directly runnable via `scqo run <name>`).
   - [ ] `python scripts/update_docs.py` re-run, so this file's experiment census AND
         estimator map include it — `tests/test_docs_current.py` fails otherwise.

**`scqo run <name>` is the single CLI entry point** — never add wrappers, launcher stubs,
or per-command shims. `scqo campaign <plan.toml>` is not an exception: it is a different
verb over a different INPUT (a plan, not an experiment name), and it REFUSES a bare
experiment name in code, pointing at `scqo run <name> --repeat N` — so "exactly one way
to run one experiment" is a checked property, not a convention.

### The readout schema (digest — full text: TUTORIAL §11)
Readout output is DECLARED, never inferred: `use_state_discrimination` (analog I/Q vs
digital) × `readout_mode` (shot vs average; `ReadoutModeParameters`, only on experiments
realizing both) + the multi-qubit joint form. Variable names carry the semantics —
`state` is ALWAYS a per-shot integer LEVEL (qutrit-capable, never a probability),
`population` the averaged marginal, `joint_population` the averaged joint distribution
of a multi-qubit target (a pair stores JOINT; marginals = partial trace, derived not
stored). `sweeps` are physics axes; readout adds its own dims (`shot_idx`, `member`,
`joint_state`) declared per accepted form via `DatasetContract.readout_dims` /
`alt_readout_dims` and validated with sweep rigor. `member`/label-digit order = roster
roles (high, low; `member` coord carries the ROLE labels). `joint_state` labels are
generated per-member level digits ("00".."11", "02" when f-resolved), never hand-listed.
A backend that cannot realize a combo REFUSES by name. Helpers live once in
`_capabilities/state_readout.py` (`states_to_joint_population` / `joint_to_marginals` /
`joint_state_labels` / `member_order`); drivers import them, scqat only reads datasets.

### The placement rule (digest — full text: TUTORIAL §10; bench: `scqo state --rule`)
Classify each USE of a quantity, in order, first match wins:
(1) gone when the run ends → per-run Parameters; (2) true of the chip in the dark
(no instrument SETTING realizes it; setup coordinates OK if declared) → role `fact`
→ physical.json; (3) measured but a vendor knob realizes it (TOF) → write the vendor
knob, catalog unit; (4) a knob the loop reads/writes vendor-neutrally → role `knob`
on its channel/composite → scqo_state.json + pushed (absolute at a declared plane =
portable; chain-fraction = non-portable, twin or catalogued scale);
(5) measured, no knob → performance of the current knobs = role `monitor`
(scqo_state.json, never pushed), else run-record-only;
(6) rest = vendor config, catalogued with kind realizer/candidate/vendor/unique —
unique locks experiments to that instrument.

### The sibling repos
All four are public. They must be cloned as **siblings under one parent directory, under
their own names** — `pyproject.toml` resolves `scqat` as `{ path = "../scqat" }` and each
driver resolves `scqo` as `{ path = "../SCQO" }`, so a renamed or nested folder breaks the
install. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the layout.

- **[scqat](https://github.com/shiau109/scqat)** — the analysis half: every estimator and
  fitter SCQO lazy-imports from `estimate()`. A hard dependency, and the one repo whose
  version SCQO pins a floor against (see `RELEASES.toml`).
- **[scqo-qm](https://github.com/shiau109/scqo-qm)** (was LCHQMDriver) - Quantum Machines (qm-qua / quam / qualibrate); the scqo surface is the `scqo_qm` package (backend/ + experiments/, one fused file per experiment); the qualibrate GUI serves the vendored OFFICIAL nodes only (the LCH shells are retired; `customized/` is a frozen archive); `quam_config/my_quam.py` stays the QUAM entrypoint.
- **[scqo-qblox](https://github.com/shiau109/scqo-qblox)** (was LCHQBDriver) - Qblox (qblox-scheduler); the `scqo_qblox` package, independent of the QM stack.
- **QBLOX_training** - the vendor's read-only Qblox example repo (`docs/applications/superconducting/...`). It is a LOCAL reference checkout on the lab machine, not part of this project and not needed to build or test anything here.

## Status
Current published release: **v3.3.0** — see `RELEASES.toml` for the combo manifest and required upgrade actions. Release history lives in git tags + `RELEASES.toml`, not here.
