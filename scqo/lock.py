"""The production cut — ``components.lock`` freeze and drift check.

docs/greenfield-schema.md section 7: at the production cut the device's
EXPANDED name set is frozen. Afterwards every load must produce a SUPERSET
by signature — (entity class, name, kind, target(s) for channels) — so
post-cut evolution is always an append:

* appending a rider to a frozen line MINTS a new name (legal), or - when
  the line already carries that target - adds the function to its channel
  (``xyz2.q2`` gains ``flux``: kinds grow, the name stays; legal);
* declaring a new mode/composite/line/channel (legal);
* declaring a new operation on a frozen composite (legal — operations are
  not part of the signature);
* re-mediating a readout (legal — via is wiring, not identity; the doctor's
  vendor witness covers it);
* REMOVING a name, or changing its kind or targets (REFUSED — store keys,
  history rows, and trends key on those). Since 4.0.0 a channel's name is
  its address ``<line>.<target>``, so moving a rider to another line is a
  removal too (``fl1.q3`` disappears, ``fl2.q3`` appears) and is refused.

Retirement is ``retired = true`` in the roster, never deletion: the name
keeps resolving, so its stored values and history stay readable.

The lock file lives beside components.toml and is written once by
``scqo device freeze``; it is data, not code — a hand-edit is a policy
decision the lab records in git.
