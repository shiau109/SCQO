"""The two per-context value stores — schema 4, one shape, two role sets.

docs/greenfield-schema.md section 1: per (cooldown, setup) the device has
``physical.json`` (facts — measured sample physics) and ``scqo_state.json``
(knobs + monitors — the operating state), both machine-written JSON. Since
4.0.0 (docs/store-by-line-plan.md) every value belongs to one OWNER entity - a
mode, a composite, an operation ``<composite>.<op>``, a line, or a channel
``<line>.<target>`` - and the file nests an owner with a dot under its first
name, so a line holds its own fields beside its channels and a composite its
facts beside its operations::

    {"schema": 4, "values": {
        "q1":  {"f_01_hz": 5.1e9, ...},
        "xy2": {"q2": {"pi_amp": 0.21, ...}, "q1_q2_c": {"pi_amp": 0.12}},
        "z1":  {"idle_flux": 0.26, "q1": {"flux_per_phi0": 0.96}},
        "q1_q2": {"iswap": {"coupler_flux": 0.0}}}}

In memory the store is FLAT, ``{owner: {field: float | [float, ...]}}`` with
dotted owner names (``flatten_values`` / ``nest_values``). A key under an owner
is a field when its value is a number or a list and a sub-owner when it is a
table; the roster guarantees no entity is named like a field.

Change provenance lives in the context's shared ``history.sqlite``
(:mod:`scqo.changes` — ONE database per scqo/ folder serving both stores
through its ``store`` column). A store loads NO history at construction;
``history()`` queries on demand and ``save()`` appends only its own new
rows, so neither cost grows with the context's lifetime. The pre-cutover
``*.history.jsonl`` sidecars are never read again — they are dead files an
operator may delete at leisure.

ONE :class:`Store` class serves both files; the difference is the ROLE SET it
accepts (``fact`` vs ``knob``+``monitor``) — routing is
:meth:`scqo.model.roster.Roster.spec` plus a role-membership check, so a fact
written at the state store is refused with a pointer to physical.json and
vice versa. Write-time validation: finite numbers only, ``float[]`` shapes
checked, paired arrays equal-length (both directions, re-checked against the
MERGED values before a save commits), a ``*_waveform`` write requires its
``*_waveform_dt_s`` companion already set.

A schema-3 file (3.x, flat channel names like ``q1_xy``) is REFUSED, never
read and never archived: its facts cannot be regenerated, so the one-time
conversion (``scripts/convert_store_v4.py``, shipped with 4.0.0 only) must run
first. A values file with no known stamp at all predates greenfield and keeps
the old fresh-start policy — archived aside (``*.v2.bak``, with any live
legacy sidecar, keep-oldest) on first contact and never read. An UNPARSEABLE
values file is quarantined alone as ``*.corrupt.bak`` — the history database
is untouched either way; provenance is never collateral damage.

Crash consistency in ``save()`` (ported from the proven store): everything
re-read and validated under the lock BEFORE the history transaction
commits (a veto rolls the transaction back — zero rows land); the commit
is the durability point, after which the unsaved buffer is cleared, so a
failed values write cannot re-append rows on retry — the retry recomputes
the values from the database; the values file lands by unique-temp +
``os.replace``. For a key several sessions wrote, the LATEST-timestamp
record wins — the persisted value always matches its newest crediting row.
Lock discipline: the values ``.lock`` file is acquired strictly OUTSIDE
and released strictly AFTER the database transaction, never inverted, so
no lock cycle is constructible.

Vendor push is NOT here — the store is pure persistence; the recording
device wrapper (phase 5) pushes knobs in catalog declaration order.
