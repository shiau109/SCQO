"""Qubit spectroscopy vs PULSED flux — the f01(flux) arch, greenfield.

Port of :mod:`scqo.experiments.qubit_spectroscopy_flux_pulse` (the probe
contract — flux applied only while the drive plays, readout at idle flux
every slice, one global IQ reference — is documented there and unchanged).
The physics half is byte-for-byte; what moved is the device surface: the
drive anchor is read from the target's DRIVE CHANNEL (``drive_freq_hz``),
the arch facts (``ej_sum_hz``, ``f_q_max_hz``) land on the target mode, and
the volts-to-flux transfer function lands on the target's FLUX CHANNEL as
``flux_offset`` / ``flux_per_phi0`` (formerly ``v_offset_v`` /
``v_per_phi0_v`` on the ZControl component).

FRAME (``_pulse`` in the name, ``FluxPulseSweepParameters`` in the schema):
the flux is a PULSE the DAC adds to the standing bias, so the window is
measured from the channel's ``idle_flux`` and 0 means "stay parked".
``estimate()`` re-references the fitted excursion to an absolute set-point
before writing ``flux_offset`` — see :mod:`._capabilities.flux`.
