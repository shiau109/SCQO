"""The punchout's resonator-mode physics, shared by both punchout carriers.

`resonator_spectroscopy_power_amp` (fast amplitude sweep) and
`..._chain` (careful chain-stepped sweep) are two MECHANISMS for one measurement,
so the standing readout knobs they propose and the physics they extract are
identical — only how the power axis is realized differs. This module owns the
half that is the same, so the two carriers cannot drift apart.

WHAT A PUNCHOUT MEASURES BEYOND THE READOUT SETTINGS: at low readout power the
qubit stays in |0> and dresses its resonator, so the dip sits at ``f_dress0``.
Driven hard enough the qubit saturates and stops dressing it, and the dip walks
to the BARE resonator ``f_bare``. That makes the punchout the one experiment that
measures the bare frequency DIRECTLY — a dispersive flux fit can only trade
``f_r0`` off against ``g`` along a degenerate valley, which is exactly why
`resonator_spectroscopy_flux` pins a stored ``f_bare_hz`` when it has one.

The loop this closes runs both ways:
``power_amp -> flux -> power_amp``. The first punchout hands the flux map a
measured ``f_bare_hz``; the flux map re-parks ``idle_flux`` at the sweet spot; a
second punchout then measures ``f_dress0_hz`` at that NEW idle point.
``old_idle_flux`` recorded on each run is what tells the two apart — the dressed
frequency is only meaningful together with the flux it was measured at, while
``f_bare_hz`` is flux-independent and durable.

    and specifically of the ``f_r0``-pin systematic that moves the flux fit's g
    by ~13% (see ``RELEASES.d/flux-design-g-seed-rescale.toml``). On 5Q4C the
