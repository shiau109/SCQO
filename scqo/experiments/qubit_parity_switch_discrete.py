"""Charge-parity monitor, DISCRETE variant — two measurements per cycle at a
fixed cycle period.

Per cycle: ``M1`` (measure) — depletion wait — ``x90`` — fixed idle — ``y90``
— ``M2`` (measure) — pad wait, repeated at the total period ``t_p``
(``cycle_period_ns``). M1 PROJECTS the qubit (measurement-based
re-initialization), the mapping block flips the pole iff the charge parity is
odd, and M2 reads the result — so the parity of cycle ``i`` is the
WITHIN-CYCLE difference ``m1[i] XOR m2[i]``, self-contained per cycle. The
idle is ``1 / (2 x parity_delta_f_hz)`` (the same derivation the continuous
sibling uses at its default), and the pulse order (x90 first, y90 second) is
physically equivalent to the continuous y90-first order up to a global sign
flip of the telegraph, which the PSD cannot see.

There is deliberately NO ``idle_multiple`` here (unlike the continuous
variant): the reason to lengthen the shot is to reach a lower spectral edge,
and this variant does that with the decay-immune ``cycle_period_ns`` pad
instead — stretching the idle would only spend T2* for no benefit M1's
re-projection does not already give.

WHY A SECOND MEASUREMENT: in ``qubit_parity_switch_continuous`` the previous
shot's measurement plays M1's role, so the readout is the running XOR of the
parity and any T1 decay between shots corrupts the XOR chain — the cadence
must stay as tight as depletion allows. Here M1 re-projects every cycle:
decay or readout error during the pad wait only shows up as a mismatch
between ``m1[i+1]`` and ``m2[i]`` (the ``p_intercycle_flip`` diagnostic) and
corrupts NO parity sample. That is what makes a LONG cycle period safe — the
telegraph may be sampled slowly, lowering the spectrum's low edge per
acquisition bin, at the price of two readouts (and two acquisition bins) per
parity sample. A single bad measurement flips exactly ONE parity sample
(continuous: two, since adjacent pairs share the shot).

The cost side: every cycle spends two readout durations, and on Qblox two
acquisition bins, so the bin-limited record halves relative to continuous at
the same cycle content — raise ``cycle_period_ns`` rather than the shot count
when reach is the goal.

Driver contract (``probe()``):

- per cycle measure ``M1`` — depletion wait
  (``scqo.experiments._depletion.depletion_wait_ns``; never ``None``) —
  ``x90`` — idle (:meth:`QubitParitySwitchContinuous.resolved_idle_ns`, per
  target, ns) — ``y90`` — measure ``M2`` — pad wait; record BOTH measurements
  of every cycle individually on the ``(shot_idx, meas_idx)`` grid,
  ``meas_idx`` 0 = M1 (no averaging exists here by design);
- NO qubit reset of any kind — M1's projection is the initialization;
- when ``cycle_period_ns`` is set, pad the cycle to EXACTLY that period and
  refuse by name if the scheduled sequence alone is longer; ``None`` means no
  pad (the minimal cycle);
- SHOULD set ``self.probe_shot_period_s[target] = <seconds>`` — the exact
  scheduled cycle period. :meth:`attach_acquisition_coords` attaches it to
  the dataset and the estimator uses it as the telegraph timebase; a period
  error scales the rate linearly.
