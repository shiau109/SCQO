"""Parametric-drive chevron — flux-modulation frequency x driving TIME, record-only.

Excite the qubit with a pi pulse, then MODULATE its own flux (z) line with an RF
tone of swept frequency at a FIXED, user-given amplitude, hold the tone for a
SWEPT driving time, and read the qubit back. Where the modulation frequency
matches a sideband condition with a coupled component (the red sideband
``|e,0> <-> |g,1>`` at the qubit-partner detuning, say), the excitation
parametrically exchanges out of the qubit and back, so each frequency row is an
oscillating ``rho_11(t)`` whose rate is the parametric coupling and whose decay
is the loss the exchange picks up. The 2D map over (frequency, time) is the
chevron: fastest, deepest oscillation on resonance, faster-but-shallower off it.

Sibling of ``qubit_parametric_drive_amp``, which fixes the TIME and sweeps the
AMPLITUDE. Run the amp map first — it locates the resonance and a usable drive
strength — then run this one at that frequency window and amplitude to
characterize the coupling it found.

THE TIME AXIS IS ON THE 4 ns GRID, not the neutral 1 ns one. This experiment is
QM-only (the parametric tone has no Qblox realization), QM's ``play(duration=)``
counts 4 ns clock cycles, and the driver sweeps that count as a real-time QUA
variable — so building the axis on the instrument's own grid makes every stored
point exactly what played, and the probe never has to round-and-re-declare the
axis the way the neutral-grid time sweeps do.

RUN THIS DISCRIMINATED. The estimator reconstructs ``rho_11`` as
``(signal - offset) / scale`` with an identity correction, so it needs a real
P(|1>): with ``use_state_discrimination`` off it falls back to the raw in-phase
quadrature, still runs, and reports rates in units of volts-per-nanosecond that
look like numbers and are not physical.

RECORD-ONLY for the DEVICE: there is no ``update()`` and nothing lands on the
device surface; the per-map summary lives in ``result.fit``. The scqat estimator
(``parametric_drive_decoherence``) reconstructs ``rho_11(t)`` per frequency and
runs the three-stage Hankel -> multi-damped-oscillation -> non-Markovian
amplitude-damping pipeline, reporting the loss rate ``gamma``, the coherent
coupling ``lambda`` and the residual detuning ``Delta`` per drive frequency plus
the exceptional-point figure of merit ``8*lambda^2/gamma^2`` (> 1 = the exchange
is coherent, i.e. a usable parametric coupling) — but it only VISUALIZES and
proposes nothing; the SUCCESS verdict (>= 1 converged frequency) is made here in
``estimate()``.
