"""Trotter-chain AC-Stark compensation scan — record-only.

The same chain ``qc_unidirectional_trotter`` runs, with ONE extra swept axis: the
AC-Stark compensation amplitude on a single chosen qubit. One run replaces the
hand scan that finding the compensation phase used to be — and because the round
axis is swept too, the slice at the optimum IS the population-vs-N curve, so the
run answers "what phase?" and "what transport?" at once.

WHY ONE AMPLITUDE AND NOT THREE. Propagating the chain's single-excitation
amplitudes through one round (swap source->relay, swap relay->sink, reset the
relay, Stark tones) gives

    |K_M| = sin(t1) sin(t2) |S0| * |SUM_j cos^(M-1-j)(t2) cos^j(t1) e^{i j dPhi}|

with ``dPhi = phi_source - phi_sink``. Only that DIFFERENCE survives: a
common-mode phase factors out, so there is one number to calibrate, not one per
qubit. Two consequences the Parameters enforce:

* the tone on the RESET qubit is inert — it fires after the reset, onto a qubit
  that has just been emptied — so ``compensation_target`` refuses it by name;
* the sum peaks at ``dPhi = 0``, so the sweep has a single optimum, and sweeping
  the source or the sink covers opposite signs of ``dPhi`` (the Stark shift's
  sign is fixed by ``stark_detuning_hz``, which is shared).

WHY THE ROUND AXIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. When the rounds cancel, only the LAST one
contributes and the sink peaks at ``N = 1``; when they add, the peak moves out to
several rounds. So ``n_at_max`` reads the phase condition independently of, and
more sharply than, the peak height — and it only exists if N is swept. The
estimator reports both.

The chain itself — the two round steps, the relay, the reset and Stark
operations, the gap, the swap coupler flux — is inherited from
``QcUnidirectionalTrotterParameters`` unchanged, so the scan and the run it
calibrates can never disagree about what the round is. That includes the
``"idle"`` operation: scanning the tone with one step idled is the background
arm, measuring what the Stark tone does on its own with no transport to move.

READOUT (the unified readout schema): digital, both modes. ``readout_mode=
"average"`` (default) stores each chain qubit's averaged marginal ``population``;
``"shot"`` keeps every shot as per-qubit integer levels. Unlike the chain
experiment this one does NOT reconstruct the joint distribution from shot mode:
the extra amplitude axis makes it a four-dimensional object that answers nothing
the scan asks. Shot mode is for keeping the raw record, and ``estimate()``
reduces it to the same marginals average mode stores.

RECORD-ONLY for the DEVICE: there is no ``update()``. A Stark compensation factor
is a per-run sequence choice with no vendor home — there is no knob to write it
to — so the optimum lands in ``result.fit`` and is passed back as the
``compensation_amps`` parameter of the next run.
