"""Single-shot readout fidelity — IQ blobs, greenfield.

Port of :mod:`scqo.experiments.single_shot_readout`. The physics half
(per-shot ``prepared_state`` x ``shot_idx`` contract, two-Gaussian fit) is
byte-for-byte; what moved is the device surface in ``update()``: the
aggregate ``readout_fidelity`` is DELETED — the per-state ``fidelity_g`` /
``fidelity_e`` monitors and the ``pos_*`` blob centers land on the target's
READOUT CHANNEL, where the discriminator knobs (``readout_rotation_rad`` /
``readout_threshold`` / ``readout_rus_threshold``) a discriminating driver
proposes now live too.
