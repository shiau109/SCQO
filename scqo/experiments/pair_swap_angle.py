"""Partial-swap ANGLE calibration — coupler flux x swap count, record-only.

Excite ONE member of a pair, then apply **N** swaps in a chain — each the SAME
swap operation, played at the SAME swept **coupler** flux amplitude — and read
BOTH members out jointly. At a fixed coupler amplitude the transfer oscillates
in N with period ``pi / theta``, so fitting a cosine per coupler row turns the
map into the calibration curve ``theta(coupler flux)``: the exchange angle you
actually get for the volts you actually set.

WHICH KNOB, AND WHY THIS ONE. TUTORIAL section 12 splits the three knobs by
role: the moving member's own flux amplitude is the **resonance** knob (it puts
the two qubits on resonance and is never the angle knob), the pulse duration is
baked into the shaped waveform and kept fixed, and the **coupler** flux is the
angle knob — ``J_eff(Phi_c)`` is continuous, so at fixed duration
``theta = J_eff * t_p`` tunes smoothly from ~0 upward. This experiment sweeps
that knob and MEASURES the resulting angle, which is the step the workflow was
missing: until now the angle was read off a figure by counting the oscillation
period by eye, and nothing recorded what angle a named operation actually is.

THE SIBLING IT IS NOT. ``qc_n_swap_amp`` sweeps the CONTROL member's flux
amplitude with the coupler left at its baked value, to find the resonance by
error amplification; it reports where transfer peaks and fits nothing. Same
sweep shape, different knob and different model — so, per the 1:1 rule, its own
estimator. Run that one FIRST (resonance), then this one (angle).

WHAT THE FIT ACTUALLY RETURNS, and why it is not always the exchange angle.
Repeating the swap does not just amplify the exchange: between swaps the two
members accumulate a RELATIVE phase ``phi`` (during the flux pulse, during
``operation_gap_ns``, and at idle). In the single-excitation subspace the round
is therefore an exchange followed by a Z rotation, and those do not commute. The
composite per-round rotation has half-angle ``theta_eff`` with

    cos(theta_eff) = cos(phi/2) * cos(theta)

and it is ``theta_eff`` that the N-oscillation reports. Two consequences:
``theta_eff >= theta`` ALWAYS — an uncompensated phase can only INFLATE the
apparent angle — and the oscillation's contrast falls as phi grows. Measured on
5Q4C 2026-09-01: at ``coupler_flux_v = 0.0``, where the coupler pulse has zero
amplitude and the swap is therefore physically identical, changing
``operation_gap_ns`` from 0 to 20 moved the fitted angle from 0.993 to 1.561 rad
— the second reading being indistinguishable from a full iSWAP.

So ``theta_rad`` is the PER-ROUND COMPOSITE angle, and equals the exchange angle
only when ``phi`` is nulled. ``compensation_amps`` is how you null it: an
off-resonant AC-Stark tone on one member adds a controllable differential phase,
exactly as ``qc_unidirectional_trotter`` compensates its chain. Only the
DIFFERENCE between the members is observable, so a tone on ONE member is enough.
Calibrate it with ``qc_n_stark_amp`` at the same swap, or scan it here across
runs and take the MINIMUM of ``theta_rad`` — the minimum is the true exchange
angle, and it is immune to decoherence because decay changes the oscillation's
amplitude, not its frequency.

READOUT (the unified readout schema): digital, both modes. ``readout_mode=
"average"`` (default) stores the pair's ``joint_population`` over ``joint_state``
labels; ``"shot"`` keeps every shot as per-member integer levels
(``state @ (target, member, *sweeps, shot_idx)``, member order high, low).
``estimate()`` reduces the shot form to the same joint distribution first, so
both modes yield identical angles.

RECORD-ONLY for the DEVICE: there is no ``update()`` and nothing lands on the
device surface. The angle is reported in ``result.fit`` and the operator sets the
coupler amplitude by re-registering the pulse (TUTORIAL section 12 step 2) —
the same hand-run writeback the rest of the pair family uses. The operation knob
``<composite>.<op>.coupler_flux`` exists in the catalog but its QM binding expects a
CZ-shaped macro and does not reach ``ISwapImplementation``, so proposing it here
would write nothing.
