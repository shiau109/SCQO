"""Qubit spectroscopy cryoscope — LONG-TIME flux step response via spectroscopy.

The complement of :mod:`qubit_ramsey_cryoscope`. Where the Ramsey cryoscope
reconstructs a phase and so is limited to the short (ns) transients before the
phase wraps, this experiment measures the qubit frequency DIRECTLY by
spectroscopy at each wait-time INTO a parked flux pulse, reaching the
microsecond tails (bias-tee droop, slow wiring transients). The sequence per
(detuning, wait) point: reset -> set the drive near the parked qubit frequency
-> play a long flux ``const`` pulse -> wait ``t`` into it -> play a long, weak
pi-area spectroscopy pulse -> read out. Per wait-time the spectroscopy peak center gives
the qubit's frequency, which maps to the delivered flux; the flux settling is fit
to a sum of exponentials -> the predistortion tap ``(amplitude, tau)`` components.

BAND-LIMITED v1: the drive is centered on the arch-predicted parked detuning
(``resolved_center_offset_hz``, derived from the catalogued arch facts, or a
nominal fallback), NOT by shifting the LO. It therefore reaches only excursions
whose detuning stays in the analog band; a gate-sized excursion needs an LO
shift, which is deferred. The detuning window is the drive_detuning capability's
explicit ``[start_drive_detuning_hz, end_drive_detuning_hz]`` range relative to
that center (ASYMMETRIC allowed — when the centering is imperfect the parked line sits
systematically to one side, so a one-sided window spends every point on signal
instead of half on empty detuning).

SPECTROSCOPY DRIVE: the probe plays a long, weak tone BUILT FOR THIS RUN — the
``drive_shape`` envelope at exactly ``drive_len_ns``, at the amplitude that holds
the calibrated x180 pulse AREA, so a longer pulse is a proportionally weaker one
and the tone stays a true pi pulse with little power broadening. The line is then
Fourier-limited at a constant set by the envelope:

    envelope                FWHM x drive_len_ns    first shoulder
    square                        0.799               11.6 %
    gaussian (sigma = T/4)        1.095                0.28 %
    gaussian (sigma = T/5)        1.285                0.01 %
    cosine (Hann)                 1.334                0.46 %

SHAPE IS NOT THE LEVER — LENGTH IS. Measured on 5Q4C q1 (2026-08-19, three runs
at one setting with only the envelope changed, drive_len_ns=100, 51 points over
30 MHz): the extracted center's scatter tracks the LINEWIDTH and nothing else —
0.0087, 0.0088 and 0.0101 MHz of scatter per MHz of FWHM for square, gaussian and
cosine. So the narrowest line wins, and that is ``square``:

    shape       measured FWHM   center scatter   drift / scatter
    square         7.4 MHz        0.064 MHz           10.1
    gaussian      14.6 MHz        0.128 MHz            7.3
    cosine        16.2 MHz        0.164 MHz            3.9

A square tone's 11.6% Rabi-nutation shoulders (at ~ +/- 8.9 / drive_len_ns; an
AREA effect, not a sinc sidelobe, so a flat top does not remove them) were the
argument for a smooth envelope — they cost nothing measurable here, while the
1.6-2x width they buy costs a factor 2-2.5 in center precision. Reach for
``cosine``/``gaussian`` only against evidence of a SHAPE problem (a split or
visibly asymmetric line), never to narrow the band.

The real ceiling is a Fourier tradeoff that no envelope escapes: wait points
shorter than ``drive_len_ns`` average the settling over the pulse, so resolving a
tail at ``t`` caps the pulse near ``t`` and the line near ``0.8 / t``.

WINDOW: keep the line a MINORITY of the detuning window (roughly FWHM <= a third
of it) — not for the fit, which is per-peak, but so the sweep keeps real baseline
either side of the line.

FRAME (deliberately NOT a ``_pulse`` experiment): the flux amplitude is a SCALAR
parameter ``flux_pulse_amp_v`` (volts RELATIVE to idle_flux — the pulse rides on
the standing bias), not a swept window, so this experiment does not subclass the
flux capability mixins and carries no ``flux`` tag. The swept axes are the drive
detuning and the (log-spaced) wait time.

WRITEBACK: accepting proposes the SAME paired flux-channel FACTS the Ramsey
cryoscope writes — ``distortion_amp`` (dimensionless, ``amp / a_dc``) and
``distortion_tau_s`` (seconds) — with whole-array REPLACE semantics. The two
cryoscopes are INDEPENDENT full measurements (short vs long timescale); accepting
one overwrites the other's taps (last-writer-wins), it does NOT compose them.
Nothing is pushed to the vendor: applying the taps to the instrument's output
filter stays a manual vendor-config step.

The base ``probe()`` raises; both drivers supply one (the Qblox probe realizes
``drive_shape='square'`` only and refuses the smooth envelopes by name).
