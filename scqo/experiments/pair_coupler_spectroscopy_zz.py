"""The coupler's 0-1 frequency at its idle point, through its ZZ with a neighbour.

Per shot: reset both members -> a tone of frequency ``f`` on the TONE member's drive
line (its ``saturation`` operation, ``tone_len_ns`` long, at ``tone_power_dbm``) ->
in the PI arm the other member (the PI member) plays a SELECTIVE pi,
``selective_pi_len_ns`` long; in the REFERENCE arm, a wait of the same length -> both
members read out 2-level. Loops: averages
(outer) -> ``f`` (start -> end) -> the two arms back to back (inner), so drift
cancels between them.

The coupler has no drive line; the tone reaches it through its hybridization with the
tone member (a coupler Rabi of about ``g / delta`` of the member's). At a coupler
transition the coupler is excited, and while it is, the qubit-coupler ZZ pulls the pi
member off its drive frequency: a pi NARROWER than the ZZ then misses, and the pi
member's excited population DIPS. The tone is off before the pi, so only what it left
behind can spoil it. The scqat estimator (``pair_coupler_spectroscopy_zz``) finds the
dips of the PI ARM alone and reads f01 as the HIGHEST, every other dip on its
multi-photon ladder (as ``pair_coupler_spectroscopy_swap``). The reference arm (no pi)
is not subtracted: the pi member's readout sees the coupler directly only while the
member is in 0 (5Q4C q1 sees q1_q2_c's f01 and f02/2 as 0.1 bumps; in 1 it does not),
so pi minus reference would dig false dips at the coupler's lines. Its own lines are
reported as a diagnostic. Unlike that experiment the coupler never moves:
no ramp, no crossing, no dependence on where the readout resonators sit.

THE PI is SELECTIVE: a square pulse ``selective_pi_len_ns`` long whose area is the pi
member's calibrated x180's, so no new calibration. On 5Q4C the ZZ is ~0.3-0.9 MHz (two
Duffing oscillators, g = 40-70 MHz): the 16 ns x180 (about +-30 MHz wide) showed no
dip on hardware, as predicted. Square, not a smooth envelope, because the coupler
decays during the pulse (T1 ~5 us on 5Q4C q1_q2_c): a smooth envelope needs about
twice the length for the same selectivity. With that decay a 2 us square leaves
0.67-0.83 of the coupler occupation as dip over the ZZ range, a 4 us cosine 0.62-0.69,
a 4 us Gaussian 0.56-0.69.

THE LINES: the tone rides on ``tone_on``'s line (default the low member - on 5Q4C q2,
the more weakly coupled line for both couplers, where f01 is cleanest) and the pi on
the other member (the more strongly coupled one, with the larger ZZ). Two members, two
ports: no second upconverter. ONE LO PER RUN, as for ``pair_coupler_spectroscopy_swap``
(``_coupler_tone``). Proposes the coupler's ``f_01_hz`` (its frequency at the CURRENT
idle) and, when the ladder shows f02/2, its ``anharmonicity_hz``; no knob is written.
One pair per run.
