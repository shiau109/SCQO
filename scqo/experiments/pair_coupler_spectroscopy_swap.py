"""The coupler's 0-1 frequency at its idle point, by swapping its excitation into a neighbour.

Per shot: reset both members -> a tone of frequency ``f`` on the TONE member's drive
line (its ``saturation`` operation, ``tone_len_ns`` long, at ``tone_power_dbm``) ->
``flux_buffer_ns`` -> in the RAMP arm, a flux waveform on the ramped line: with
``ramp_v = (first, last)`` it jumps to ``first`` at once, runs linearly to ``last`` at
``ramp_rate_v_per_us``, and drops back to idle at once; in the REFERENCE arm, a wait
of the same length ->
``flux_buffer_ns`` -> both members read out 2-level. Loops: averages (outer) -> ``f``
(start -> end) -> the two arms back to back (inner), so drift cancels between them.

The coupler has no drive line; the tone reaches it through its hybridization with
the tone member (a coupler Rabi of about ``g / delta`` of the member's). At ``f = f_c`` the
coupler is excited. The slow ramp then carries the coupler across a member
ADIABATICALLY - the excitation moves into it - and the sudden return is diabatic, so
it stays there. Which member receives it differs from pair to pair (5Q4C: q1 of
q1_q2, q2 of q2_q3), so the signal is the TOTAL excitation 1 - P00. The reference
arm keeps the excitation in the coupler; a neighbour's readout may still see it
there (5Q4C q1 sees q1_q2_c), so a reference line does not rule a line out. The
scqat estimator (``pair_coupler_spectroscopy_swap``) takes the ramp arm's lines,
keeps those the ramp CHANGES (ramp minus reference), and reads f01 as the HIGHEST of
them: driven hard the coupler shows its multi-photon ladder below it (f02/2 = f01 +
alpha/2, f03/3 ~ f01 + alpha), and every other coupler line must sit on that ladder.
Through the more strongly coupled member's line f01 broadens and f02/2 becomes the
strongest line, so drive through the weaker one. A line one or two sweep steps wide
is ignored - re-measure it with a finer step.

THE RAMP is ``ramp_v = (first, last)`` in PLAY order, and only its slow segment
(first -> last) is adiabatic: every crossing inside a jump (idle -> first, last ->
idle) is passed diabatically, and the member the slow segment crosses FIRST receives
the excitation. So ``(0, 0.14)`` swaps on the way out (slow out, fast back) and
``(0.14, 0)`` jumps out and swaps on the way BACK. On 5Q4C the second is the one that
works: the coupler (7.06 GHz) sits above the readout resonators (5.87-6.08 GHz),
which sit above the qubits, and swapping on the way back means the coupler crosses
the resonators again only after its excitation has gone to a qubit (2026-09-27; with
the coupler above both members the way back meets the OUTER one, the low member,
first). The slope sets the adiabaticity - Landau-Zener depends only on the rate at
which the crossing is passed: on 5Q4C q1_q2 the coupler slope at q1's crossing
(b = +0.109 V) is 22 MHz/mV, so 0.15 V/us is 99 % adiabatic at g = 50 MHz.

Every ramp voltage is a pulse amplitude relative to the ramped line's ``idle_flux``
(recorded as ``old_ramp_idle_flux``); ``ramp_v`` has no default - its far end comes
from ``pair_coupler_crossing_pulse``'s crossing plus about 30 mV.

ONE LO PER RUN: the tone window is ABSOLUTE and at most 500 MHz wide, played as
+-250 MHz of IF around one LO at its center. Proposes the coupler's ``f_01_hz`` (its
frequency at the CURRENT idle) and, when the ladder shows f02/2, its
``anharmonicity_hz``; no knob is written. One pair per run, as for
``pair_coupler_crossing_pulse``.
