"""Resonator spectroscopy vs flux — the dispersive flux map, greenfield.

Port of :mod:`scqo.experiments.resonator_spectroscopy_flux`. The physics
half is byte-for-byte; what moved is the device surface and the field
spellings: the flux-transfer facts land on the target's FLUX CHANNEL
under their new names (``v_offset_v`` -> ``flux_offset``,
``v_per_phi0_v`` -> ``flux_per_phi0``), the sweet-spot idle point is
two channel knobs (``idle_flux`` on the flux channel, ``readout_freq_hz``
on the readout channel), and the dispersive physics (``f_bare_hz``,
``g_hz``) goes on the attached RESONATOR mode.

FRAME (no ``_pulse`` in the name, plain ``FluxSweepParameters``): the probe
SETS the line's DC offset to each swept value, so the window is ABSOLUTE DAC
volts and its fitted ``flux_offset`` is already an absolute set-point — the
plane the ``_pulse`` experiments re-reference themselves onto. See
:mod:`._capabilities.flux`.

    """The arch-top qubit frequency to hold FIXED in the dispersive fit, and where
    it came from.

    WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS: ``f_q_max`` is not fitted (the trace fixes
    only the PRODUCT ``g^2 * f_q_max`` — see the estimator's degeneracy note), so an
    assumed value cannot be corrected by the data. The error lands in ``g``
    (``g^2 ~ max_pull * detuning``, so an overstated detuning inflates it) and in
    ``f_r0``, which the fit must push further below the trace to keep the model's
    top:bottom pull ratio; that is what makes the fitted curve dive under the data at
    the LOW sweet spot. Sourcing a measured value fixes both at once.

    Precedence, best first:

    1. the target's standing ``drive_freq_hz`` — the qubit frequency AT THE PARKED
       FLUX, which is the arch top exactly while the qubit sits at its sweet spot;
       the same proxy, and the same reason, ``qubit_spectroscopy_cryoscope`` uses
       for its arch curvature. When a PREVIOUS map already stored the arch
       (``flux_offset`` + ``flux_per_phi0``), :func:`_arch_top_from_parked` removes
       that assumption by projecting the parked frequency back to the top and the
       tag becomes ``drive_freq_arch``; at the sweet spot the correction is exactly
       nothing (the 5Q4C qubits park within 0.5 mV of theirs, so it is a guard for
       a deliberately detuned park rather than a numeric fix);
    2. the fab's ``junction_resistance_ohm`` through Ambegaokar-Baratoff
       (:mod:`._transmon_estimate`) — as-FABRICATED, so it beats the datasheet
       whenever the qubit has not answered yet;
    3. the datasheet's ``f_q_max_hz``;
    4. ``None`` — the estimator applies its own placeholder, and f_r0/g are withheld.

    A FOREIGN flux source is excluded from 1: the arch being swept is then not the
    target's own, so the target's drive frequency says nothing about it. (2 and 3
    still apply — they describe the target's own junction either way.)

    The auto-source is also declined for a qubit sitting ABOVE its resonator: the
    model pulls the resonator UP (``g^2 / (f_r0 - f_q)`` with ``f_r0 > f_q``, a bound
    the estimator enforces), so such a device is outside the dispersive method
    altogether and 'assumed' — which withholds f_r0/g rather than reporting a
    clamped fit as physics — is the honest answer.

        ``readout_freq_hz`` = ``sweet_spot_res_hz`` (read out at the resonator dip
        there — a later readout_frequency run refines it for fidelity).

        resistance, or the datasheet (``fit["f_q_max_source"]``, see

        sine method yields no such physics, and when nothing was known the estimator
        holds f_q_max at a placeholder guess that the trace cannot correct, so g is
        conditional on that assumption — an assumed value must never enter the
        measured-physics ledger. The gate is per QUBIT: on a multi-target run one
        qubit may be anchored and another not. ``f_q_max_hz`` itself is never
