"""Charge-parity monitor, CONTINUOUS variant — a fixed y90-idle-x90 sequence
sampled as a back-to-back shot trace. (The two-measurement-per-cycle sibling is
``qubit_parity_switch_discrete``.)

After a beat-model ``qubit_ramsey`` retunes the drive to the MEAN of the two
charge-parity branches, the branches sit at +/- parity_delta_f_hz / 2 around
the drive. A fixed free evolution of ``t = 1 / (2 x parity_delta_f_hz)``
accumulates a parity-dependent phase of exactly +/- pi/2, and the 90-degree
SHIFTED second pulse (y90 ... x90) measures sin of it — odd in parity, so the
two parities land on opposite readout poles (a same-axis pair would measure
the even cos and see nothing). Repeating the sequence back-to-back turns
parity switches into a random telegraph signal; the Welch-PSD Lorentzian
corner gives the per-direction switching rate (rate = pi x corner, scqat's
``fit_telegraph_psd``), written back as the mode fact ``parity_rate_hz``.

STRETCHING THE IDLE (``idle_multiple``). The idle may instead be taken as
``N / (2 x parity_delta_f_hz)`` for ODD N: the parity phase is then
``+/- N pi/2`` and the readout still reads sin of it at full contrast. EVEN N
gives exactly zero (both parities land on the same pole) — allowed, but warned
about, and the fit then refuses it for lack of spectral contrast.

Why bother: a run is usually limited by ACQUISITION BINS rather than by wall
clock, so a longer shot buys more recorded time out of the same bin budget and
therefore a lower spectral edge. On chipA (30.4 us shots) the Qblox 3e6-bin
ceiling caps a run at 91 s (f_min 0.088 Hz); N=3 stretches the shot to ~48.5 us,
so the same bins buy 145 s (f_min 0.055 Hz). It also suppresses the
readout-error bias, which scales as ``1 + 2 eps / (rate x shot_period)``. The
ceiling is T2* — contrast decays as ``exp(-idle / T2*)`` — and that is NOT
checked automatically, because ``t2_star_s`` is a mode FACT and mode facts are
unreachable at ``define_sweep`` time.

Between shots only the RESONATOR is reset (the ``readout_depletion_s`` wait).
The Parameters deliberately carry NO ``reset_method``, and the absence is
load-bearing rather than an optimization — see below.

THE READOUT IS NOT THE PARITY; ITS CONSECUTIVE DIFFERENCE IS.
The sequence is a unitary, so it maps antipodal Bloch vectors to antipodal
ones: |0> and |1> can never produce the same outcome. Each shot therefore
starts wherever the previous measurement projected it (no reset, QND readout)
and its outcome INVERTS with that pole:

    s[i] = s[i-1] XOR parity[i]

so the readout trace is the RUNNING XOR of the parity, and the consecutive-pair
difference ``s[i] XOR s[i+1]`` IS the parity telegraph. scqat fits that pair
series, never the raw readout — fitting the readout means fitting an integrated
telegraph and the rate is meaningless (that was the v0.19.0 defect). The raw
readout's spectrum is still plotted, unfitted, as a diagnostic.

This is also why a qubit reset would BREAK the experiment rather than merely
cost time: resetting to |0> every shot severs the XOR chain that carries the
parity. And the shot cadence IS the telegraph timebase, so the loop must
contain exactly the scheduled operations and a governed depletion wait.

Driver contract (``probe()``):

- per shot play ``y90`` — idle (:meth:`QubitParitySwitchContinuous.resolved_idle_ns`,
  per target, ns) — ``x90`` — measure, and record EVERY shot (``shot_idx`` is
  a labeled sweep dim; no averaging exists here by design);
- between shots insert ONLY the depletion wait
  (``scqo.experiments._depletion.depletion_wait_ns``; never ``None`` — this
  experiment refused already) and NO qubit reset of any kind;
- SHOULD set ``self.probe_shot_period_s[target] = <seconds>`` — the exact
  scheduled shot-to-shot period. :meth:`attach_acquisition_coords` attaches it
  to the dataset (falling back to a knob-based estimate) and the estimator
  converts the per-shot switching rate into Hz with it; a period error scales
  the rate linearly.
