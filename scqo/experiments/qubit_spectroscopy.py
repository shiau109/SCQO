"""Qubit spectroscopy — coarse two-tone 0->1 search, greenfield.

Port of :mod:`scqo.experiments.qubit_spectroscopy`. The physics half is
byte-for-byte; what moved is the device surface and spellings: the anchor
and the recalibrated knob land on the target's DRIVE CHANNEL
(``drive_freq_hz``), while its measured twin ``f_01_hz`` stays a fact on
the target mode — ``update()`` writes both from the one fit. The
saturation-power boundary is the ported :mod:`._drive_power` helper.
