"""Greenfield ``flux_component`` mixin — kind-agnostic foreign flux source.

The old shared mixin's field text described pair-name coupler routing and
the deleted ``flux_component_categories`` ClassVar; the greenfield gate is
channel-existence (any entity with a default flux channel — a qubit, a
tracked coupler mode). The old mixin's text is test-enforced against the
old stack, so the greenfield ports carry their own until the final cutover
relocates the capability modules.
