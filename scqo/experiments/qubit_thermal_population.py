"""Residual excited-state population at idle — prepare |g>, count the |e> shots.

``single_shot_readout`` already reports this number (``pop_e_prep_g``) as a
by-product of preparing BOTH states. This experiment prepares only |g> and
spends every shot on the ground-state cloud, which is what a 1-5% population
needs: the number is a small minority of a large sample, so the statistics —
not the fit — set the error bar.

Because only one state is prepared there is nothing in the data that says where
|e> is. The blob centers come from the readout channel's stored ``pos_*``
monitors (an accepted ``single_shot_readout`` run), pinned into the mixture fit;
the experiment REFUSES to run without them rather than inventing a second
center from a cloud that has only one. That reference is snapshotted into
``dataset.nc`` at acquisition time, so the analysis replays offline unchanged.

Both readings are reported, and they are not one quantity by two methods:
``assign_e_prep_g`` is COUNTED (nearest-center hard assignment — population PLUS the
readout overlap error) and ``pop_e_prep_g`` is the FITTED mixture weight
(population with the overlap removed). The fitted one is the chip fact ``n_th``.
