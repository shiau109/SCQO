"""Qubit Ramsey cryoscope — flux-line step response via Ramsey phase tomography.

Measure the flux line's transient (step) response so its distortions can be
compensated. The probe plays a flux pulse of swept DURATION inside a Ramsey
sequence (``x90`` - flux pulse - fixed total idle - ``frame_rotation`` - ``x90``)
and sweeps the closing pulse's FRAME through a full turn; the qubit's
flux-dependent detuning imprints a phase that grows with the accumulated flux.
The estimator reconstructs that phase per duration, differentiates it into a
detuning, maps it to the delivered flux (``sqrt`` of the quadratic arch),
NORMALIZES by the settled tail, and fits the resulting step response to a sum of
exponentials — the predistortion tap ``(amplitude, tau)`` components.

FRAME (deliberately NOT a ``_pulse`` experiment): the flux-pulse amplitude is a
SCALAR parameter ``flux_pulse_amp_v`` (volts RELATIVE to the flux channel's
``idle_flux`` — the pulse rides on the standing bias), not a swept window, so this
experiment does not subclass the flux capability mixins and carries no ``flux``
tag. The swept axis is the pulse DURATION. The amplitude only sets SNR: the
estimator normalizes by the settled tail, so the recorded taps are relative and
no flux-frequency curvature calibration is needed.

WRITEBACK: accepting proposes the paired flux-channel FACTS ``distortion_amp``
(dimensionless, ``amp / a_dc``) and ``distortion_tau_s`` (seconds) — the measured
cryo-wiring physics. They land in physical.json and are NEVER pushed to the
vendor: applying them to the instrument's output filter (e.g. the OPX
``exponential_filter``) stays a manual vendor-config step. Semantics are REPLACE
— each accepted run records the full step response measured that run.

The base ``probe()`` raises; both drivers supply one (scqo-qm bakes the 1-16 ns
segments, scqo-qblox composes each duration from a voltage-offset segment plus a
1-3 ns remainder waveform).
