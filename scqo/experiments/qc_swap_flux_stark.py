"""Fixed-N flux-amplitude x AC-Stark-amplitude swap map — record-only.

Excite ONE member of a pair, then apply a FIXED number ``swap_count`` of swaps —
each at the same swept control-qubit flux amplitude (absolute volts) and each
followed by an off-resonant RF Stark tone on the excited member at the same swept
amplitude factor — and read BOTH members out jointly. Two amplitudes are swept,
the swap count is not: the map is ``(flux amplitude x stark amplitude)`` at one N.

WHY BOTH AXES AT ONCE. The two knobs are not independent. The control flux brings
the members onto resonance during the pulse, while between swaps they accumulate
a relative phase ``phi`` (from the flux pulse, the gap and the idle), and an
exchange followed by a Z rotation does not commute::

    cos(theta_eff) = cos(phi/2) * cos(theta_exchange)

so the per-round composite angle is inflated, AND the composite rotation axis
tilts off the equator by ``cos(theta)*sin(phi/2)`` — which moves the amplitude
where the transfer peaks away from zero detuning, by roughly ``phi / t_p``. On a
40 ns swap that offset is comparable to the resonance linewidth. Scanning one
knob at a fixed value of the other therefore walks a ridge of a 2D surface;
``qc_n_swap_amp`` (flux x N) and ``qc_n_stark_amp`` (stark x N) each see one
slice of it. This experiment sweeps the surface.

TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE READING THE MAP:

1. **At ``swap_count = 1`` the stark axis is INERT.** The tone plays after each
   swap, so the only tone of a single-swap run sits between the last swap and the
   readout: it imprints a phase on the excited member and cannot move any
   population. The map is flat along the stark axis by construction. The phase
   the Stark tone compensates only exists BETWEEN swaps, so give N at least 2 —
   and more, since repetition is what amplifies a small residual.
2. **The map's 2-D argmax is NOT the calibration**, on either axis. ``T(N)``
   goes as ``sin^2(N*theta_eff)``, so at a fixed N the flux that transfers best
   is the one where ``N*theta_eff = pi/2`` — off resonance whenever the per-round
   angle exceeds ``pi/(2N)``. Measured on 5Q4C q1_q2 (2026-09-20): the N=2 map's
   ``best_flux_amp_v`` sat 3.25 mV from resonance, more than half the 5.75 mV
   FWHM, while the N=1 map's ``best_stark_amp`` was a draw between 21
   statistically identical cells. ``best_transfer`` and its coordinates stay in
   ``result.fit`` as the map summary they are; the CALIBRATION is the
   compensation ridge the estimator fits across the flux rows (see the Result).

HOW THE RIDGE IS READ, and what the prior is for. Along any FIXED flux row the
largest transfer is at ``phi = 0`` exactly — the row's own compensation — as long
as ``theta <= pi/N``; the line through those per-row optima is the ridge, and it
gives the compensating amplitude at any flux including one whose own row carried
no signal. Locating the RESONANCE on that ridge, and turning its transfer into an
angle, both need to know how far ``N*theta`` has run, which a fixed-N map cannot
tell you. That is what ``swap_angle_rad`` supplies — a prior from a preceding
``pair_swap_flux_map``, used as a branch selector rather than a fitted value, and
accurate to ``pi/(2N)`` is enough.

READOUT (the unified readout schema): digital, both modes, exactly as
``qc_n_swap_amp`` — ``readout_mode="average"`` (default) stores the pair's
``joint_population`` over ``joint_state`` labels; ``"shot"`` keeps every shot as
per-member integer levels (``state @ (target, member, *sweeps, shot_idx)``,
member order high, low). ``estimate()`` reduces the shot form to the same joint
distribution, so both modes yield identical maps.

RECORD-ONLY for the DEVICE: there is no ``update()`` and nothing lands on the
device surface; the summary and the ridge read both live in ``result.fit``. The
scqat estimator (``qc_swap_flux_stark``) draws the raw joint state populations —
a per-pair 2x2 population figure — plus a second figure for the ridge, with
plotdata/metadata under ``analysis/<pair>/``. It fits, but it proposes nothing;
the SUCCESS verdict (``min_transfer``) is made here in ``estimate()``, not by the
estimator, and a run whose ridge never converged is still SUCCESSFUL if the
transfer cleared the threshold.

    Map summary — ``best_transfer`` (peak excitation on the UNDRIVEN member —
    which member that is follows from the ``drive_side`` parameter) and its
    ``best_flux_amp_v`` / ``best_stark_amp`` coordinates, plus the per-map
    marginal ranges ``p_high_min/max`` and ``p_low_min/max``, ``p_ee_max`` (the
    double-excitation witness) and the axis sizes. **Those two ``best_*``
    coordinates are the raw 2-D argmax and are NOT the calibration** — at N >= 2
    the flux argmax sits where ``N*theta_eff = pi/2``, which is off resonance,
    and at N = 1 the stark argmax is a draw between statistically identical
    cells. Read the ridge keys instead.

    Ridge read (:data:`RIDGE_KEYS`) — ``compensating_stark_amp`` at
    ``resonance_flux_amp_v`` is the answer, with ``swap_angle_rad_refined`` the
    N-amplified exchange angle. Each is behind its own gate: ``ridge_ok``
    (``N*theta <= pi``) for the first pair, ``branch_ok`` (``N*theta <= pi/2``)
    for the angle, both decided by the ``swap_angle_rad`` prior and both NaN
    when shut. A third way to get nothing is ``resonance_in_gap``: the resonance
    row carried no stark signal, so there is nothing local to interpolate and
    reaching it would need a phase-vs-amplitude model this experiment does not
    carry.

    Ungated — ``ridge_peak_flux_amp_v`` is the flux where the phase-compensated
    transfer is largest, with ``ridge_peak_transfer`` its height. It needs no
    prior because it is a MEASUREMENT rather than a claim, so it is the flux to
    act on from a run that carried no priors at all; it equals
    ``resonance_flux_amp_v`` whenever the angle has not folded, and is one of
    the two flanks instead when it has — which is precisely what the prior is
    there to tell you.

    Diagnostics — ``ridge_slope_per_v`` is how fast the compensation moves with
    the flux (how tightly the flux must be held) and ``ridge_local_rms`` how
    well the stark axis resolved the ridge; a run whose rms approaches the stark
    step is under-sampled and its compensation is worth no more than that step.
    ``ridge_wrap_amp`` is the ``2*pi`` period the map measured for itself,
    ``wrap_consistent`` compares it with the ``stark_amp_2pi`` prior,
    ``n_fold_rows`` counts the rows whose arcsin was unfolded,
    ``n_ridge_rows`` / ``max_row_contrast`` say whether the stark axis carried
    signal at all, and ``swap_angle_consistent`` compares the refined angle
    against the prior without acting on it.
