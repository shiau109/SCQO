"""State-readout capability: the digital (FPGA-discriminated) acquisition modes.

An experiment HAS this capability exactly when its Parameters subclass
:class:`StateReadoutParameters`; the catalog derives the ``"state_readout"``
capability from that subclass relation (never from a declared string). The capability owns
the Parameters fields (one canonical text), the contract fragments
(``POPULATION_ALT`` / ``SHOT_STATE_ALT``), the simulate-side draws and packers,
the estimate-side rename (:func:`signal_rename`), and the joint-population
reduction helpers of the unified readout schema.

THE READOUT SCHEMA (canonical text: TUTORIAL "The readout schema"; digest in
CLAUDE.md). Readout output is declared by two axes plus one multi-qubit form:

* ``use_state_discrimination`` — analog (``I``/``Q`` volts) vs digital
  (discriminated) acquisition;
* ``readout_mode`` — ``"average"`` (FPGA-averaged, no shot axis) vs ``"shot"``
  (every shot kept on a trailing ``shot_idx`` dim);
* a DIGITAL + AVERAGE multi-qubit target stores the JOINT distribution
  (``joint_population`` over a ``joint_state`` label dim) — marginals are its
  partial trace, derived not stored.

The variable names carry the semantics: ``state`` is ALWAYS a per-shot integer
level (0/1/2… — a qubit may read out |2>), ``population`` is the averaged
marginal probability, ``joint_population`` the averaged joint distribution.
A backend that cannot realize a requested combo REFUSES it by name, never
downgrades.

BOUNDARY RULE: the field name ``use_state_discrimination`` and its semantics
(True => the probe returns discriminated data; False => ``I`` + ``Q``)
cross the probe boundary on BOTH backends — LCHQMDriver shells pass it verbatim to
the vendor ``build_program``; LCHQBDriver reads it in ``experiments/_state.py`` and
asks for the ``ThresholdedAcquisition`` protocol — so NEITHER side is ever renamed.
The two realize the same semantics on different vendor knobs (QM's readout-operation
``threshold``, Qblox's ``element.measure.acq_threshold``), which is why the
discriminator fields are ``portable=False``: the calibrated numbers do not transfer.

``attach_readout_positions`` deliberately does NOT ride along: it is an
Experiment ClassVar owned by experiments whose scqat estimator consumes the
stored blob centers (axial IQ reduction) — orthogonal to whether the probe can
return discriminated data.
