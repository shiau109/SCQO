"""Amplitude-sweep capability: the absolute amplitude behind a swept RATIO.

Five experiments sweep a drive or readout-channel amplitude as a dimensionless
FACTOR of whatever the target currently stores — ``qubit_power_rabi`` and
``qubit_pi_pulse_error`` against the drive channel's ``pi_amp``,
``qubit_deterministic_benchmarking`` against ``pi_amp`` or ``pi_amp_x90``, and
``readout_power`` (the readout pulse) and ``qubit_resonator_stark`` (its Stark
tone) against the readout channel's ``readout_amp``.

THE RATIO IS THE INPUT, ON PURPOSE. One factor array serves every target in a
multiplexed run: q1 with ``pi_amp`` 0.15 and q2 with 0.35 are each driven around
their OWN pi pulse from the same sweep. A single shared ABSOLUTE window cannot do
that, and the narrow-window carriers (``readout_power`` 0.4-1.8x, the two
+/-10% error-amplification scans) would be unusable on any non-uniform chip. So
the parameter stays a ratio, and the absolute amplitude is DERIVED PROVENANCE —
never an input, never something a caller sets.

What this module adds is that provenance: :func:`attach_absolute_amp` writes the
``digital_amp`` coordinate onto the acquired dataset, so a run folder answers
"what amplitude actually played?" on its own. Without it the absolute value
exists only in the fit dict, as ``old_<knob> * factor``, and a saved
``dataset.nc`` cannot be read without separately recovering the device snapshot
from the moment of the run.

``digital_amp`` IS DIMENSIONLESS — the 0-1 normalized amplitude the ``pi_amp`` /
``pi_amp_x90`` / ``readout_amp`` knobs carry (``unit=""`` in ``catalog.py``): a
fraction of full scale on both backends (QM's MW-FEM amplitude is a fraction of
the port's ``full_scale_power_dbm``; Qblox's ``amp180``/``pulse_amp`` are
fractions of DAC full scale). It is NOT volts and NOT dBm — absolute POWER is
``drive_power_dbm`` / ``readout_power_dbm`` and belongs to the punchout
experiments. The name is deliberately the one
``resonator_spectroscopy_power_amp`` already uses for this same quantity.

The coordinate name is shared with the punchout family, but the ATTACH POINT is
not: this one runs in ``Experiment.run()``, so the values reach ``dataset.nc``;
the punchout attaches inside ``estimate()`` onto its local prepared dataset, so
they reach only the figure.

An experiment HAS this capability exactly when its Parameters subclass
:class:`AmplitudeSweepParameters`; the catalog derives the ``"amplitude"``
capability from that subclass relation (never from a declared string). The capability owns
the window Parameters (canonical names + texts), the canonical sweep-axis name
(:data:`AMP_AXIS` — the probe boundary both drivers emit and read), and the
absolute-axis attach.

A carrier declares ONE thing and inherits the rest::

    def amp_reference_field(self) -> str: ...       # the knob the ratio multiplies

``amp_reference_field`` returns a BARE FIELD NAME, never a (channel kind, field)
pair: :meth:`Experiment.anchor` resolves it through ``Roster.resolve_field``
(qubit-closure addressing), and ``catalog.py`` asserts that no field name appears
in two channel-kind catalogs — so ``"pi_amp"`` already means ``q1_xy`` and
``"readout_amp"`` already means ``q1_ro``. Passing the kind as well would be a
second, unchecked source of truth. It is a METHOD rather than a ClassVar because
``qubit_deterministic_benchmarking`` picks its knob from ``target_gate``.

The axis is ``amp_prefactor`` and not ``amp_factor`` because that is already the
name in scqat (all three amplitude estimators), in the QM probes and in the QM
qualibrate nodes — choosing it DELETES boundary renames instead of adding them,
including a positional-fallback hop in the QM backend's ``_to_canonical``.

THE WINDOW IS A TRAVERSAL ORDER: ``start_amp_factor`` -> ``end_amp_factor``, in
either direction, and the dataset keeps the order the probe walked (decided
2026-09-26) — a strong readout or Stark tone leaves the next point heated, so
which way the amplitude went must be the caller's choice and visible in the data.
scqat's estimators cannot tell the direction, so it never changes a fitted number.
Only a zero-width window is refused (``.._window``), and the bounds hold on BOTH
edges, since either one may be the larger. A carrier that overrides
:meth:`AmplitudeSweepParameters.amp_values` must keep that order too.
