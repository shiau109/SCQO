"""Flux-sweep capability: a swept flux-bias window on a z line.

An experiment HAS this capability exactly when its Parameters subclass
:class:`FluxSweepParameters`; the catalog derives the ``"flux"`` capability from
that subclass relation (never from a declared string). The capability owns the window
Parameters (canonical names; NOT a rail bound — see :class:`FluxSweepParameters`,
the limit is the backend's, per port), the canonical
sweep-axis name (``FLUX_AXIS`` — the probe boundary: LCHQB/LCHQM probes emit and
read exactly this axis), the assignable foreign flux source
(:class:`FluxComponentParameters`), and the record-only ``update()`` guard
(:func:`foreign_flux_source`).

TWO FRAMES, ONE AXIS. The window is volts either way, but the ORIGIN differs and
is decided by the PROBE MECHANISM:

* **absolute** (:class:`FluxSweepParameters`) — the probe SETS the line's DC
  offset to each swept value (QM ``z.set_dc_offset(dc)``), so 0 V is the DAC
  zero and the window is the line voltage itself.
* **relative** (:class:`FluxPulseSweepParameters`) — the probe PLAYS a pulse on
  top of the standing bias (QM ``z.play("const", ...)``), which the DAC adds to
  the idle offset. 0 is then "stay parked" and the window is an excursion
  measured from the flux channel's ``idle_flux`` knob.

A relative carrier MUST end its registered name in ``_pulse`` (pinned by
``tests/test_capabilities.py``), so the frame is legible wherever the name is —
the CLI menu, a run folder, the AI loop's decision surface. The frame is also
recorded per run: every carrier writes ``old_idle_flux`` into its fit, which is
:func:`flux_anchor_v` — 0.0 in the absolute frame, the standing bias in the
relative one. Both keep ``FLUX_AXIS`` as the axis KEY: the frame is an origin,
not a different quantity, and a second key would fork both drivers' probes and
scqat's coords for nothing the name and the recorded origin do not already give.

The FACTS the two frames produce stay absolute in both: a relative carrier
re-references (``absolute = old_idle_flux + fitted``) before writing
``flux_offset``, because that field is a property of the chip's transfer
function, not of where the run happened to be parked.

THE WINDOW IS A TRAVERSAL ORDER: ``start_flux_v`` -> ``end_flux_v``, in either
direction, and the dataset keeps the order the probe walked. Consecutive flux
points are not always independent — a long pulse tail, heating, hysteresis in the
SQUID loop — so which way the sweep went has to be the caller's choice and visible
in the stored data (decided 2026-09-26). The analysis side cannot tell the
direction (scqat canonicalizes on entry), so the order changes what the instrument
did, never a fitted number. Only a zero-width window is refused; the mechanism and
the rationale are shared with the detuning and amplitude windows in ``.._window``.

``pair_zz_coupler`` is deliberately NOT on this capability: it sweeps a pair's
tunable coupler through the ``coupler_bias`` operation and keeps its coupler
naming.

Session._validate_targets stays in ``session.py`` — session must never import
this package (importing any ``scqo.experiments`` submodule triggers the package
``__init__``'s eager import of every experiment module; session stays lazy). The
per-class narrowing of what a foreign source may be remains the
``flux_component_categories`` Experiment ClassVar, which session already reads.

    NO RAIL BOUND HERE — deliberately. This layer is vendor-neutral and cannot
    know one: an OPX1000 LF-FEM port reaches ±0.5 V in ``direct`` mode and ±2.5 V

    used to be ``ge=-0.5``/``le=0.5``, which hardcoded one vendor's *direct-mode*
    rail into the shared API: it fired at Parameters construction, before any
    backend was consulted, so no driver-side fix could make an amplified-mode
    sweep runnable at all.

    The backend refuses what its port cannot emit, by name and with the remedy —
    the same shape as ``reset_method="active"``, which the neutral layer offers
    and a backend that cannot realize it refuses rather than downgrades.
