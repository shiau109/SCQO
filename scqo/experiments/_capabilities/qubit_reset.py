"""Qubit-reset capability: how a target returns to |g> between shots.

An experiment HAS this capability exactly when its Parameters subclass
:class:`QubitResetParameters`; the catalog derives the ``"qubit_reset"``
capability from that subclass relation (never from a declared string). Every experiment
that pulses a qubit and reads it out needs one, because shot-to-shot
independence is the assumption its averaging rests on.

THE SETTLE AFTER AN ACTIVE RESET IS NOT HERE. It is the readout channel's
``readout_depletion_s`` knob, calibrated from the measured linewidth by
``resonator_spectroscopy`` and resolved by ``_depletion.depletion_wait_ns`` —
see that module for why (it is this capability's own logic one level over:
a measured FACT, a factor, a proposed channel KNOB). It briefly lived here as a
per-run field, which was wrong: the photon-depletion time is a property of the
resonator and the readout condition, identical for every experiment that
measures, so it is device state and not a per-run choice.

Two methods exist: ``"thermal"`` (wait out the qubit's own relaxation) and
``"active"`` (measure, then play a pi pulse only if it came back excited).
Active reset is ~100x faster on a real chip, and it is why the discriminator
knobs are worth calibrating for their own sake — but it is NOT universally
realizable, so see the BOUNDARY RULE below.

WHERE THE WAIT LIVES (thermal only): the standing value is the neutral knob
``thermalization_time_s`` on each target's DESIGNED drive channel
(``xy1.q1``; a borrowed channel never carries it) — role
``knob``, so it is stored in scqo_state.json and pushed to the vendor
(QM: ``q.thermalization_time_ns``; Qblox: ``element.reset.duration``).
``qubit_relaxation`` proposes ``thermalization_factor x t1_s`` for it, and it is
settable by hand (``scqo set q1.thermalization_time_s=2e-4``) before any T1
exists. The Parameters field is a per-run OVERRIDE only.

BOUNDARY RULE: drivers resolve the wait through :func:`reset_wait_ns` and never
re-implement the precedence — one point of truth, so the per-run override can
never mean different things on QM and Qblox. ``reset_method`` crosses the probe
boundary verbatim (it maps onto QM's own ``reset_type`` vocabulary), so neither
side renames it.

AND: a backend or experiment that cannot realize the requested method must
REFUSE IT BY NAME — never silently downgrade to thermal. A method the caller
asked for and did not get is the one failure this field cannot survive: the run
completes, the data looks plausible, and only the wall clock disagrees.
``"active"`` is realized on both backends for coherent-drive carriers whose
readout condition is fixed for the whole run; everything else raises. **The
opt-in set is not symmetric and must never be assumed equal** — a carrier may
ship on both backends and opt in on only one (``qubit_ramsey_phasor`` opts in on
QM and is denied on Qblox pending its hardware run). Which carriers, and the
per-backend envelope (Qblox plays a fixed number of ConditionalResets, QM runs
QUAM's repeat-until-success loop), are documented at each refusal site and pinned
by each driver's own census test, not here — this module owns the vocabulary, not
the per-backend policy.
