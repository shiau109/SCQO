"""Qubit phasor Ramsey — T2* and the residual drive detuning from a frame lock-in.

A Ramsey sequence (``x90`` - idle - ``frame_rotation`` - ``x90``) in which the
closing pulse's FRAME is swept through a full turn at every idle time. The
fringe therefore lives in the FRAME axis rather than in the time axis, and a
complex lock-in at one cycle per turn collapses each fringe to a single phasor:
its MAGNITUDE is the coherence envelope and its ANGLE the accumulated phase.

Two consequences, and they are the whole point of the experiment:

* Because the time axis no longer has to resolve a fringe, it is free to be
  LOG-spaced. That is what makes the stretch exponent ``p`` of the decay
  measurable — inside a fraction of one decay time every exponent fits equally
  well — so this experiment reports the SHAPE of the dephasing (``p = 1``
  Markovian/white, ``p = 2`` the Gaussian decay of a 1/f-dominated environment)
  as well as its time constant. Plain ``qubit_ramsey`` cannot: its linear axis
  is spent resolving the fringe.
* NO ARTIFICIAL DETUNING is applied, and none is offered. The contrast is
  detuning-independent (the fringe is in the frame axis), so an artificial
  detuning would buy nothing and only alias the phase; with it at zero the
  phase slope IS the residual frequency error. This also drops the negative
  virtual-detuning ramp — and its sign trap — from both probes.

The lock-in is blind to the readout rotation by construction (a constant
rotation is a global phase on the phasor), so unlike ``qubit_ramsey`` this
experiment does NOT attach stored blob centres: there is no axial projection to
resolve. It also cancels the readout offset exactly and rejects the ``m = 2``
harmonic an over-rotated pi/2 pulse produces — the latter only for
``num_frames >= 4``, which is why that is the floor rather than the lock-in's
bare minimum of 3.

WRITEBACK: accepting proposes the mode fact ``t2_star_s`` (the same free-
induction dephasing quantity ``qubit_ramsey`` measures — identical sequence,
different readout of the envelope) and, when the phase fit is valid, corrects
the drive channel's ``drive_freq_hz`` knob together with its measured twin
``f_01_hz``. The stretch exponent is reported in the result but not written
back: there is no catalogued field for it yet. The detuning is NaN-gated — the
estimator refuses to unwrap past the point where the branch is ambiguous — so
the frequency proposal is skipped rather than poisoned when the phase record
runs out.

The base ``probe()`` raises; both drivers supply one.
