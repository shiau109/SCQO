"""Readout time of flight — when the readout pulse comes back.

The instrument emits a readout pulse and digitizes its own input. Between the
two sits the round trip: the output chain, the cables into the fridge, the
sample, the cables out, the amplifiers and the input chain. The acquisition
window has to be opened by exactly that much or the integration window and the
pulse do not overlap — which costs readout fidelity with nothing saying so,
because a mis-aligned window still returns a perfectly well-formed number.

Nothing else measures it. It is the one quantity here that is VENDOR-ONLY on
BOTH backends by design — QM's ``resonator.time_of_flight`` (ns) and Qblox's
``measure.acq_delay`` (s) — so this experiment proposes NOTHING and pushes
NOTHING. It measures, and prints where to write the answer (:mod:`._tof_hint`).
Run it after a re-cabling, a fridge cycle that moved a line, or an instrument
swap.

The sequence, identical on both backends: play the readout pulse, open the
acquisition window at a DECLARED EARLY ORIGIN, and record the RAW digitizer
samples averaged over shots. The trace reads noise, then a step, then a
plateau; the step is the delay.

Why the origin is declared, and not the value already configured
----------------------------------------------------------------
Opening the window where the channel currently points is the intuitive choice
and it is wrong: if the current value happens to be RIGHT, the pulse is already
present at sample 0, there is no pre-arrival baseline, and the threshold has
nothing to sit between. The measurement would work only while it was not
needed. So the window opens as early as the instrument allows
(``window_start_ns = 0``) and the answer is ``window_start_ns + arrival`` —
which also makes it independent of how wrong the current setting is.

``window_start_ns = 0`` means "as early as this instrument allows" and each
driver reports its own floor. A NON-ZERO value is a promise: below the floor it
is REFUSED BY NAME rather than quietly raised, because an operator who asks for
a specific origin is usually reproducing an old run.

Phase, and the one way this fails quietly
-----------------------------------------
The trace is AVERAGED over shots, so each shot must start at the same digital
oscillator phase or the cosine averages toward zero and the step disappears
into the noise. Both probes reset it per shot. If the figure shows a flat |IQ|
with two quadratures that look like noise, that is the thing to check first —
the fit reports ``arrival_unresolved`` rather than a number.

The reading (scqat ``readout_time_of_flight``, bound here 1:1): a robust
baseline and plateau, a threshold midway between them, and an interpolated
first crossing, plus the 10-90 % rise time and a saturation check. The absolute
delay is rounded onto the instrument's timing grid (4 ns on both shipped
backends) because that is what the vendor field accepts — a real delay need not
be a multiple of 4, so ``arrival_ns`` keeps the unrounded measurement beside it.
