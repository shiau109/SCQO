"""The resonator-depletion wait: THE precedence point, and its one canonical text.

The readout twin of ``_capabilities/qubit_reset.py``, deliberately built to the
same shape because it is the same logic one level over:

===================  ==============================  ==============================
                     thermal reset                   resonator depletion
===================  ==============================  ==============================
measured FACT        ``t1_s`` (qubit mode)           ``kappa_tot_hz`` (resonator)
measured by          ``qubit_relaxation``            ``resonator_spectroscopy``
per-run FACTOR       ``thermalization_factor`` 10    ``depletion_factor`` 10
proposed KNOB        ``thermalization_time_s``       ``readout_depletion_s``
   ... on            the DRIVE channel (xy1.q1)      the READOUT channel (fl1.q1)
per-run override     ``thermalization_time_ns``      ``readout_depletion_ns``
precedence helper    ``reset_wait_ns``               :func:`depletion_wait_ns`
===================  ==============================  ==============================

WHY A KNOB AND NOT A PARAMETER: the wait is a property of the resonator and the
readout condition, identical for every experiment that measures it, and it is
realized by a real vendor field on both backends (QM
``q.resonator.depletion_time``, Qblox ``element.depletion.duration``). That is
placement-rule step (4), the same step that makes the thermal wait a knob while
``t1_s`` stays a fact. It was previously TWO per-run Parameters fields that could
disagree with each other and with the vendor.

THE FACTOR IS A CHOICE, THE LINEWIDTH IS A FACT. ``kappa_tot_hz`` is the
power-Lorentzian FWHM in Hz, so the photon-number decay time is
``1 / (2 pi x kappa_tot_hz)`` and the wait is ``depletion_factor`` of those.
10 leaves e^-10 ~ 0.005% of the photons. At kappa/2pi = 1 MHz that is 1592 ns.

WHY THIS RETURNS None RATHER THAN RAISING, unlike ``reset_wait_ns``: its two
callers have legitimately different policies for "never calibrated". Active reset
REFUSES (a missing settle silently biases the next pulse, which shows up as a
fitted-frequency error nobody attributes to the reset). The punchout probe falls
back to its own built-in idle, because it worked that way before this knob
existed and a bring-up sweep must not require a calibration it is being run to
inform. Making the caller state its policy keeps both visible.
