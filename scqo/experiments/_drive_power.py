"""Shared drive-power boundary for saturation-drive experiments — greenfield.

Port of :mod:`scqo.experiments._drive_power`. The boundary discipline is
unchanged (recorded set of ``drive_power_dbm`` before acquisition, exact
revert afterwards — the punchout discipline of
``resonator_spectroscopy_power_amp``); what moved is the device surface:
the knob lives on each target's DRIVE CHANNEL, so the boundary reads and
writes through ``experiment.device.channel(t, "drive")`` views instead of
the old component views. ``qubit_spectroscopy`` and
``qubit_spectroscopy_flux_pulse`` share this ONE implementation instead of
copy-pasting the try/finally.

    ``targets`` defaults to the experiment's own targets; a pair experiment passes
    the MEMBER whose drive line carries the tone (its targets are pairs, which have
    no drive channel).

    Each target's standing ``drive_power_dbm`` is read and validated FIRST (a
    single unknown/non-finite chain aborts before any write, so the device is
    never left half-set), then all are written to ``target_dbm``, the body runs
    (acquisition), and the ``finally`` reverts every target to its standing
    value — 2 ChangeRecords + coupled ``drive_amp`` echoes per qubit. While the
    chain is off its standing value the stored pi_amp means a different power; no
    pi pulse is played by these experiments, and the revert is exact (discrete
    chain knob, the amplitude restored verbatim).
