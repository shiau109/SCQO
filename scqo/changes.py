"""Per-context change-history database — ``history.sqlite``.

One SQLite file per (cooldown, setup) context, sitting in the context's
``scqo/`` folder next to ``physical.json`` and ``scqo_state.json`` and
serving BOTH stores through the ``store`` column (``'physical'`` |
``'state'``). It replaces the two ``*.history.jsonl`` sidecars: appends are
O(new rows) instead of a whole-file rewrite, readers get indexed queries
instead of a full parse, and a Session no longer loads any history at
construction.

The file is TRUTH, not a cache: manual ``scqo set`` writes, accept
timestamps and external-change evidence exist nowhere else, so — unlike
``index.sqlite`` — it is never dropped on a version bump and must never be
deleted. It is deliberately PER CONTEXT because lab aggregation is a folder
copy + reindex, never a database-level merge (INSTALL "Merging data from
another server"): a context has exactly one writing machine, so per-context
files merge across servers by copy for the same reason run folders do. A
per-device database would collide the moment two operators share a device
and cooldown but drive different setups from their own data_roots.

Write discipline mirrors :meth:`scqo.datastore.DataStore._connect`:
short-lived connections, WAL (best effort), ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` for the one
write transaction, always closed (Windows file locks; closing the last
connection also checkpoints and removes the ``-wal``/``-shm`` side files, so
an idle context folder stays copy-clean). Read methods NEVER create the
file: they stat first and connect ``mode=ro``, which is what lets the
read-only viewer browse an unwritten tree without minting databases.

Ordering contract everywhere: ``ORDER BY timestamp, seq`` — ``seq`` (the
rowid) breaks same-timestamp ties by insertion order, reproducing the old
sidecar merge's stable-sort rule. Lexicographic timestamp order ==
chronological order rests on the lab's fixed UTC offset (see
:func:`scqo.stores._now`). ``old``/``new`` are JSON-encoded so ``float[]``
waveforms round-trip; the index deliberately excludes them.
