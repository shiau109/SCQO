"""Suggested updates — captured from ``update()``, decided by a human.

Greenfield port of :mod:`scqo.suggestions`. An experiment's ``update()``
never writes directly: the session swaps a :class:`SuggestionCapture` shadow
device in around the call, so every write — attribute-style on mode/channel
entities, ``write_knob`` on composites — becomes a :class:`Suggestion`
instead of a live write. The captured list is stored on the run record
(``record.json`` — the truth) with per-item status pending/accepted/rejected.

Routing carries the field's ROLE (the one store-vocabulary of the model):
``fact`` applies to the physical store, ``knob``/``monitor`` through the
recording device. Cross-entity proposals are first-class — a resonator fit
captured while targeting ``q1`` lands on ``q1_res`` and is reviewed under
that name. Values may be arrays (a suggested waveform) — ``before``/``after``
are ``float | list[float]``.

Rows from the pre-greenfield era (``component``/``category`` keys) are
display-only: :func:`load_suggestions` refuses to DECIDE them, with a message
saying so (the fresh-start rule for record data that stays readable).
