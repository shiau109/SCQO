"""In-memory device + simulated backend + the demo device — greenfield.

These let the whole model run end-to-end with no instrument and no vendor
library — unit tests, demos, AI dry-runs. A driver's real backend is a
drop-in replacement for :class:`SimulatedBackend`; a real vendor tree is a
drop-in for :class:`InMemoryDevice`.

The demo device is generated as REAL components.toml / design.toml text and
parsed through the real loaders — every test that uses it exercises rider
expansion, design validation, and seeding, not hand-built entity objects.
