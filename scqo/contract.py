"""Canonical dataset contract per probing method.

Each probing method declares the dataset its probe must emit (and its estimator
consumes): the ``qubit`` dimension, the swept axis (name + unit), and the required
data variables. This is the explicit API between *driving* (any instrument's probe)
and *analysis* (the one shared estimator).

It also makes "support" a single, testable property: an instrument **supports** a
method exactly when its probe emits a dataset that conforms here — at which point the
shared estimator is guaranteed to apply. Drivers can therefore certify a probe with one
call (``Experiment.Contract.validate(probe_output)``); SCQO itself enforces it at
runtime in :meth:`Experiment.run`.

The contract is deliberately SCQO-neutral (e.g. ``idle_time_ns`` in ns), independent of
any estimator's internal coordinate names; the estimator-specific renaming lives in one
place (each ``estimate()``), so probe authors never depend on SCQAT's naming.
