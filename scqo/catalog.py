"""Kind catalogs — WHAT kinds of entities exist and WHICH fields each owns.

The greenfield replacement for :mod:`scqo.categories` (docs/greenfield-schema.md
sections 2, 6, 7). Three kind families share one field machinery:

* **mode kinds** — quantum degrees of freedom (``transmon`` .. ``resonator``);
* **composite kinds** — named mode groups with joint physics (``qubit_pair``);
* **channel kinds** — one signal on a line (``drive``/``readout``/``flux``/``pump``).

The old two-category-slots-per-name routing is gone: every entity has exactly
ONE kind, and a field's store follows its ROLE — ``fact`` -> physical.json,
``knob`` -> scqo_state.json (pushed to the vendor, in declaration order),
``monitor`` -> scqo_state.json (never pushed).

The frozen ``DERIVATION`` table is the single (channel kind x target kind)
authority: it names the derived single-mode operation, the rider suffix, and —
by the ABSENCE of a row — what is illegal on both birth paths (a flux channel
targeting a fixed transmon is a load error, not a pruned field). Composite
operations are never here: they are DECLARED in the roster and carry the
``OP_KNOBS`` per-operation field family.

Catalogs are assembled per kind by spreading a base dict and overriding — each
kind owns its complete field list; there is no shared-facts inheritance tier.
``_validate_catalog()`` enforces the registration lints at import time.
