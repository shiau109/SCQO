"""Result schemas — the *extraction surface*.

Analysis returns a structured, machine-readable ``Result`` (not just a figure), so a
human or an AI agent can read the extracted quantities and the per-qubit pass/fail
outcome and decide what to do next. Figures, if any, are referenced by path elsewhere
and are intentionally kept out of this schema.
