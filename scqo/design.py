"""The design.toml loader — the chip datasheet, validated against the roster.

docs/greenfield-schema.md section 7 ("design.toml"): entity-named tables (the
``design.`` prefix dissolved into the filename), loaded and validated AFTER
roster expansion — an unknown entity is a load error, a field that is not
design-legal for the entity's kind is a load error naming the legal set.
Context-free vocabulary only, enforced per field by ``FieldSpec.design_ok``
(f_01_hz design-legal solely on fixed transmons; flux-tunables use
f_q_max_hz). Shape mirrors physical.json key-for-key, which makes the
doctor's design-vs-measured column a trivial join (:meth:`Design.compare`).

Design values are DECLARATIONS, not measurements: hand-edited TOML, no
provenance flow, editable after the production cut. A missing file is an
empty datasheet, not an error — design is optional per entity and per field.

The bring-up seed lives here too: :func:`seed_value` resolves a channel
knob's ``design_source`` hop (``drive_freq_hz <- target.f_01_hz``,
``readout_freq_hz <- via.f_dress0_hz``). The anchor order stays standing state,
else design (this module), else code default — callers try in that order.
