"""Session building for the CLI: device -> cycle -> named setup -> backend.

Real instruments are served by DRIVER packages that register a factory under the
``scqo.backends`` entry-point group (name = the backend family)::

    [project.entry-points."scqo.backends"]
    qblox = "scqo_qblox.scqo_backend:build_backend"

A factory is ``build_backend(cfg: LabConfig, setup: dict, roster: Roster) ->
Backend`` — ``setup`` is the device's SELECTED named setup record from its cooldown
registry (``backend``, optional ``note``, plus the DERIVED ``instrument_config``
vendor folder injected by ``load_cooldowns`` —
``<device>/<cooldown>/<setup>/backend_config``, never typed), and ``roster`` is the
device's authority on which entities exist: a driver serves views BY ENTITY NAME
(``q1_xy`` -> its drive view over the vendor's q1 element), so it must resolve
each channel's target and kind through the roster rather than parsing names.
``simulated`` (demo qubits, synthetic data) is built in here, so query commands,
practice runs and CI need no driver at all.
