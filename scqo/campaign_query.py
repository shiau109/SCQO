"""Latest campaign statistics per (target, quantity), across campaigns.

A campaign records aggregate ``statistics`` per experiment, target and quantity.
This resolves them INDEPENDENTLY per (target, quantity): if q1's T1 is in
campaign A and q3's T1 is in campaign B, each takes its own latest qualifying
campaign rather than forcing one campaign to answer for the whole chip.

``DataStore.find_campaigns`` returns newest-first, so the first qualifying
occurrence of a quantity IS the latest one.
