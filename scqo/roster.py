"""The components.toml loader — topology in, validated entity graph out.

The device model of docs/greenfield-schema.md (sections 3-5, 7) with the 4.0.0
store-by-line addressing (docs/store-by-line-plan.md). The file declares four
sections — ``[modes]``, ``[composites]``, ``[lines]``, ``[channels]`` — and this
loader:

1. parses them into typed entities (scalar-or-list normalized to tuples;
   the internal model contains no unions);
2. EXPANDS rider lists into DESIGNED channels named ``<line>.<target>``: a
   rider entry declares that the line carries that function to that target, and
   readout riders also mint the target's ``<t>_res`` resonator mode (ref
   ``qubit=<t>``), stamped with (line, rider, index) provenance. An explicit
   ``[channels.<label>]`` joins the same channel ``<line>.<target>``; a pump or a
   multi-target channel (a joint readout) is ``<line>.<label>``, and a
   multi-target FLUX channel (a broadcast coil) is one channel per target -
   what a flux channel owns is the per-target transfer function;
3. mints one OPERATION entity ``<composite>.<op>`` per declared operation;
4. enforces the NAMESPACE collision rule on declared and minted names alike;
5. resolves and validates every reference: mode refs, composite roles
   (arity + kind typing + no entity in two roles + required roles + DAG over
   composite refs), channel targets against the (channel kind x target kind)
   DERIVATION table — identical for riders and explicit channels — THEN the
   readout ``via`` default (the unique resonator whose qubit == target; zero
   or several candidates = via required, candidates named);
6. adds the BORROWED channels: every mode a drive line can reach but does not
   carry by design, ``<line>.<mode>`` - a coupler driven through a neighbour's
   line, a qubit through a foreign one. They need no declaration; which line
   drives the mode is part of their name;
7. COMPILES per-entity legal-field sets: the kind catalog of a mode or a
   composite, OPERATION_FIELDS on an operation, the line-level fields of the
   kinds a line carries (a flux line's idle_flux / flux_delay_s / distortion
   taps), and the channel fields of every kind on a channel (a borrowed channel
   without the target-owned ``designed_only`` ones). All later validation
   (stores, design.toml) is set membership. The lock (``Roster.signatures``)
   freezes the SIGNATURES of the declared and designed entities only.

Design values do NOT live here: a ``[design]`` table (or an in-table
``design`` key) is refused with a pointer to design.toml. ``retired = true``
is legal in every section (post-cut decommissioning keeps names resolving).
