"""SCQO-native device config + change history — the loop's durable memory.

SCQO owns a **neutral calibration config** (a peer to the vendor configs — QM
``state.json``/``wiring.json``, Qblox ``HardwareAgent`` — not derived from them) and
**records every change** to it. :class:`RecordingDevice` wraps a backend's
:class:`~scqo.device.DeviceModel`:

* reads are served from the SCQO config (authoritative);
* writes append a :class:`ChangeRecord`, update the SCQO config, then **push** the value
  to the vendor device so the instrument runs calibrated.

On construction it **seeds** the config from the vendor (pull). If a saved SCQO state
exists, what happens depends on ``on_load``:

* ``"pull"`` (default, safe while another tool may also write the vendor config — e.g.
  unmigrated qualibrate nodes on QM): the vendor wins at startup; only the saved
  **history** is loaded so provenance stays continuous.
* ``"push"`` (for devices SCQO fully owns, e.g. simulated): the saved SCQO config is
  loaded **and pushed to the vendor** — SCQO wins for the tracked calibration fields.

Either way, a *write* during a run always records + pushes: a fresh fit result is
always legitimate. Wiring/hardware stays vendor-owned and is never modelled here.

The state is **per (cooldown, setup)** (:func:`scqo.datastore.setup_scqo_dir`:
``<device>/<cooldown>/<setup>/scqo/scqo_state.json`` holding the current values,
with the change history in the append-only sidecar ``scqo_state.history.jsonl`` —
see :mod:`scqo._state_io`): every value is a fact about qubit + setup, so two users
on two setups of one sample never share (or clobber) a file, and every
:class:`ChangeRecord` is stamped with the writing session's setup name. Saves merge
history under a lock file, so two same-setup sessions cannot erase each other's
rows. The sample's measured physics lives beside it as ``physical.json`` (+ its own
sidecar) in the same folder (:mod:`scqo.physical`).

**Two classes of fields** (see :data:`FIELDS`): *pushed* calibration knobs
(readout_freq, drive_freq, pi_amp, readout_amp, readout_power_dbm) behave as above;
*record-only*
instrument-DEPENDENT measured values (readout_fidelity) are recorded into the SCQO
config + history but NEVER pushed — the instrument has no such knob, and drivers
need no code for these. Pull-mode startup merges saved record-only values back in
(the vendor snapshot cannot carry them). Every change record is stamped with the
**operator** (OS login) — attribution works for manual notebook writes too.

Instrument-INDEPENDENT physics (T1, T2*, transmon-arch and dispersive-fit
parameters) is NOT a device field: it belongs to the sample and lives in
:mod:`scqo.physical` (``physical.json``), written through the same
suggest -> review -> accept flow (:mod:`scqo.suggestions`).
