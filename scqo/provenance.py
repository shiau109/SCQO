"""Live-source provenance — which run does each CURRENT value trace to?

The values in use matter more than the pending ones. For every (qubit, field)
with a current value, the LAST ChangeRecord for that pair is the candidate
source; under the STRICT-MATCH rule it is credited only while its recorded value
still equals the live value. A drifted value (the vendor reseeded at startup,
qualibrate wrote QUAM directly, someone hand-edited a config) is reported as
"external" — a run is NEVER credited for a value the device no longer runs.

Pure functions over plain dicts, no I/O: the viewer feeds them the state files
(``scqo_state.json`` config+history / ``physical.json`` values+history), the
Session feeds them its live state (:meth:`scqo.session.Session.live_sources`),
and both get the same answer for the same facts.
