"""Doctor witnesses over the greenfield model — structured, renderer-free.

Every check returns :class:`Check` triples ``(status, topic, message)`` in
the CLI's existing shape, so ``scqo doctor`` stays a renderer and the same
witnesses are callable from tests, the viewer, and an AI loop.

The witnesses are the ones docs/greenfield-schema.md section 7 names, plus
the roster-internal ones the loader cannot enforce (it validates structure;
these judge FITNESS — an unreachable mode loads fine and is still a lab
problem). Vendor witnessing takes the driver's realized inventory and its
line->port annotation as data; the drivers supply both at the Phase-6
cutover, and every check degrades to a clear WARN when they are absent.

:func:`profile_residency_checks` is the one ENVIRONMENT witness (the
multi-account-server trap, INSTALL §1) — kept here so every doctor row
shares this renderer-free home.
