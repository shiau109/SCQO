"""Bridge to the shared analysis engine (scqat).

SCQO does not fit anything itself: every experiment's ``estimate()`` delegates to
EXACTLY ONE scqat estimator, and that estimator is bound by exactly one experiment —
the binding is 1:1 in both directions, because an estimator is keyed by a READING (a
dataset shape AND the model fitted to it) and a binding is therefore a claim that this
model describes this signal. Share math through ``scqat.tools`` instead; the rule and
its decision procedure are in ``CLAUDE.md`` -> Terminology -> The estimator binding.
This module holds the pieces every experiment shares — the per-target split and its
whole-dataset sibling, each wrapping the ``analyze`` loop — and is the only place scqat
is imported.

scqat is imported **lazily** (inside the function) so ``import scqo`` stays light and
free of the analysis stack; the import only happens when analysis actually runs.

    ``prepared`` must already carry the variable and coordinate names the estimator
    expects (e.g. ``signal`` + ``idle_time``); the per-experiment ``estimate()`` does
    that renaming/scaling. This helper only splits along ``qubit`` and calls
    ``analyze`` once per qubit, returning ``{qubit_name: results_dict}``. Extra
    keyword arguments are forwarded to ``analyze`` (estimator knobs, e.g. ``ec_ghz``).

    ``per_target_kwargs`` carries knobs whose VALUE differs per qubit — the stored
    blob centers a pinned-center fit needs, say. They are merged over the shared
    ``estimator_kwargs`` (per-target wins) for that qubit only; a qubit absent from
    the mapping just gets the shared set.

    With ``artifact_dir`` set (the Session does this when a datastore is configured),
    each qubit's scqat artifacts — ``<estimator>_metadata.json``, ``_plotdata.nc`` and
    figure PNGs — are written to ``artifact_dir/<qubit>/``; without it, analysis stays
