"""Bridge to the shared analysis engine (scqat).

SCQO does not fit anything itself: every experiment's ``estimate()`` delegates to a
single scqat estimator (one estimator per probing method). This module holds the one
piece both share — the per-qubit split + ``analyze`` loop — and is the only place
scqat is imported.

scqat is imported **lazily** (inside the function) so ``import scqo`` stays light and
free of the analysis stack; the import only happens when analysis actually runs.

    ``prepared`` must already carry the variable and coordinate names the estimator
    expects (e.g. ``signal`` + ``idle_time``); the per-experiment ``estimate()`` does
    that renaming/scaling. This helper only splits along ``qubit`` and calls
    ``analyze`` once per qubit, returning ``{qubit_name: results_dict}``.

    With ``artifact_dir`` set (the Session does this when a datastore is configured),
    each qubit's scqat artifacts — ``<estimator>_metadata.json``, ``_plotdata.nc`` and
    figure PNGs — are written to ``artifact_dir/<qubit>/``; without it, analysis stays
    in-memory and figures are skipped (standalone use, tests without persistence).
