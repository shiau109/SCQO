"""Instrument-independent physical parameters of the SAMPLE — the measured-physics ledger.

The instrument config (:mod:`scqo.config`) answers "how do I drive this qubit *on this
setup*"; this store answers "what IS this qubit" — coherence times, transmon arch
parameters, dispersive-fit quantities. Every value is a measurement of the sample
**through a setup, in a cooldown** (a noisy drive line shortens the measured T2
through no fault of the sample; ``dv_phi0_v`` is volts at the DAC, wiring-dependent),
so the file is PER (cooldown, setup) — one context, flat values::

    <data_root>/<device>/<cooldown>/<setup>/scqo/physical.json
        {"values":  {"q0": {"t1_s": 2.5e-05}},
         "history": [ChangeRecord, ...]}          # rows also carry setup=

A setup's estimate never overwrites another's — they are different files. Compare
across setups/cooldowns by querying the run index (every run stamps cooldown + setup)
or the trends page. The setup-INDEPENDENT sample truth is Phase-3 *inference* over
these measurements (``sample.json``, a separate future per-sample output).

Values are written through the same suggest -> review -> accept flow as calibration
knobs (see :mod:`scqo.suggestions`): an experiment's ``update()`` *proposes*, a human
(or an explicitly auto-applying caller) accepts, and every accepted value lands here
with full provenance (experiment / run_id / operator / setup ChangeRecords, exactly
like the instrument-config history). Nothing in this module ever touches a vendor
object. ``save()`` merges under a lock file rather than blindly rewriting — two
same-context sessions cannot erase each other's rows.

Instrument-DEPENDENT measured values (readout_fidelity, thermal population) do NOT
belong here — they stay in the instrument state / run records with ``backend``
provenance, compared across instruments by query.

      unique token into the lock file; release unlinks ONLY if the token still
      matches. So if our lock were ever deemed stale and taken over while we
      paused, we do not delete the new holder's lock out from under it.
