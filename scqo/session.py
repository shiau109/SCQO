"""Session — the single entry point used identically by humans and AI agents.

Everything crosses this boundary as plain JSON-able Python (dicts / lists), so the
same calls drive a manual notebook *and* an LLM tool-use loop:

    sess = Session(backend, state_path="scqo_state.json", data_root="D:/qpu_data")
    sess.catalog()                     # what can I measure? (with parameter schemas)
    sess.run("qubit_ramsey", {...})    # measure -> structured result (+ run_id + suggestions)
    sess.accept(run_id)                # apply the run's suggested updates (or a subset)
    sess.reject(run_id, comment="...") # decline them (metadata only)
    sess.find_runs(experiment="qubit_ramsey", qubit="q0")   # find my data (pending=True too)
    sess.load_run(run_id)              # reload a saved run (record/params/result/figures)
    sess.device_state()                # current calibration (the SCQO config)
    sess.physical_state()              # the sample's measured physics (physical.json)
    sess.history()                     # every recorded change (the loop's memory)

No vendor/hardware object is ever exposed here. The Session owns the **authoritative
SCQO config + change history** (a :class:`~scqo.config.RecordingDevice` wrapping the
backend's vendor device) and, when ``data_root`` is given, a
:class:`~scqo.datastore.DataStore` that persists **every** run — dataset, parameters,
result, device snapshots, and the scqat analysis artifacts (figures included).

        ``update`` selects what happens to the fitted values after a successful run:

        * ``"suggest"`` (default) — ``update()`` runs against a capture shim: every
          write becomes a pending :class:`~scqo.suggestions.Suggestion` (qubit, field,
          store, before, after) returned in the payload's ``suggestions`` key and
          stored on the run record. NOTHING is applied — a human decides, right away
          (the CLI prompts) or later via :meth:`accept` with the run_id.
        * ``"apply"`` (or legacy ``True``) — capture, then immediately accept every
          suggestion through the same apply path: calibration knobs are pushed to the
          vendor + recorded in the change history, physical fields land in
          ``physical.json``, and both states are persisted. The pre-v0.6 behavior,
          kept for the AI loop / unattended bring-up.
        * ``"none"`` (or legacy ``False``) — analyze only; nothing is even captured.

        A failed run (a non-conforming probe dataset or a raising estimator) is
        returned as a structured result with ``error`` set and every qubit marked
        failed, never raised: the Session boundary stays JSON in/out. ``updated_device``
        on the run record means "at least one suggestion has been APPLIED" (a later
        :meth:`accept` flips it).

        With a ``data_root`` configured, **every** run — successful or failed — is saved
        to its own run folder and indexed; the returned dict gains ``run_id`` and
        ``data_path``. ``tags`` (merged with the Session's ``default_tags``) and ``note``
        are stored searchably. A persistence failure never destroys a measurement
        result: it is reported as ``datastore_error`` in the returned dict instead.

        Standing per-experiment defaults (``parameter_defaults``, wired from
        ``~/.scqo/parameters.toml`` by :func:`~scqo.labconfig.make_session`) are merged
        under ``params`` first — code defaults < defaults file < ``params``. Parameters
        that do not validate (a typo'd key, an out-of-range value) return a structured
        all-failed result naming the offending key — and, when it came from the defaults
        file, the file's path. Nothing is measured then and nothing is persisted (no
        ``run_id``): unlike a probe/estimator failure there is no dataset to debug.

        first-class). Two guards protect a deferred apply unless ``force``:

        * **era guard** — the run's (cooldown, setup era) must match the device's
          current one: a value measured under different wiring may not transfer;
        * **staleness guard** — each item's ``before`` must equal the store's CURRENT
          value: if something else updated the field since, the item is skipped and
          reported under ``stale``.

        ``reapply=True`` re-decides items that were ALREADY accepted/rejected —
        roll back to this run's value after regretting a newer one, or accept an
        item rejected earlier. A rollback deliberately overwrites a newer value, so
        the staleness guard is OFF in this mode (the summary's ``current`` field
        shows exactly what each item overwrote); the era guard still applies.

        era mismatch is reported rather than raised, and the selection always
        includes decided items (the preview must describe what a re-apply would
