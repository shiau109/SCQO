"""Session — the single entry point used identically by humans and AI agents.

Greenfield port of the state half of :mod:`scqo.session` (the run()/catalog()
experiment flow plugs in with the experiment-base cutover). Everything
crosses this boundary as plain JSON-able Python, so the same calls drive a
manual notebook and an LLM tool-use loop::

    sess.set_values({"q0.pi_amp": 0.2})   # runless manual write, validated,
                                          #   recorded as (manual)
    sess.suggest(run_id, {"q0.readout_freq_hz": 5.91e9})  # attach a
                                          #   figure-read value to a run
    sess.accept(run_id)                   # apply pending suggestions
    sess.reject(run_id, comment="...")    # decline them (metadata only)
    sess.device_state()                   # per-entity operating state
    sess.qubit_state("q0")                # the per-qubit assembled view
    sess.physical_state()                 # the sample's measured physics
    sess.history()                        # every recorded change

Addressing is the QUBIT-CLOSURE sugar (:meth:`Roster.resolve_field`):
``q0.pi_amp`` routes to ``q0_xy``, ``q0.readout_freq_hz`` to ``q0_ro``,
``q0.f_dress0_hz`` to ``q0_res`` — explicit entity names always work. Suggestions
carry the field's ROLE; applying routes facts to the physical store and
knobs/monitors through the recording device (vendor-push-first).

        """Walk a :class:`~scqo.campaign.CampaignPlan`'s steps ``repeat`` times.

        OUTER repetition: every (repeat, step) is a full :meth:`run` with its own
        run folder, dataset, fit and TIMESTAMP, stamped with
        ``(campaign, repeat_idx, step_idx)``. Interleaved by construction — the
        outer loop is the repeat — so every quantity within one repeat shares a
        drift epoch and ``T1[k]`` is comparable with ``T2*[k]``. Returns the
        manifest: status, counts, the per-(experiment, target, quantity)
        statistics, and the repeat skeleton.

        ``update`` defaults to ``"none"``, inverting :meth:`run`'s default
        deliberately. Each child would store its OWN pending suggestion set, all
        capturing the same ``before``; accepting repeat 0 moves the store, so
        repeats 1..N-1 would every one report ``stale`` — N sets of undecidable
        proposals. ``"suggest"`` is therefore REFUSED for more than one repeat.
        The writeback happens ONCE instead, at finish: the statistics are
        replayed through each experiment's own ``update()`` and stored as
        campaign-level PENDING suggestions on the manifest (policy:
        ``plan.writeback``; decide with :meth:`accept_campaign` /
        ``scqo accept --campaign``). ``"apply"`` is allowed with a warning:
        legitimate for a repeated RE-TUNING campaign, but it moves the device
        under its own measurement (so the statistic measures the feedback
        loop, not the qubit) — and no aggregate suggestions are generated (the
        series is a feedback trace, not repeated measurements of one value).

        PRE-FLIGHT: before repeat 0 every step's Parameters are constructed and
        the roster target gate is run — both pre-hardware, no side effects. A
        plan with a typo'd parameter or an off-roster target is REFUSED WHOLE,
        with a per-step problem list, instead of failing identically N times.
        Nothing is created on disk in that case.

        A repeat counts as FAILED only when NO step in it produced a success —
        the instrument-disconnected signature. One flaky estimator among four
        steps shows up as ``n_missing`` in the statistics, not as a failed
        repeat, so it cannot trip ``on_error`` or the consecutive-failure
        breaker on an otherwise healthy overnight run.

        Never raises once the plan is valid. The manifest is finalized in a
        ``finally``, so it is written on EVERY exit path — a normal stop, Ctrl-C
        anywhere (including the cadence sleep, where a campaign with ``period_s``
        spends most of its wall clock), or an unexpected error (``status="failed"``
        with the exception named). An interrupted repeat keeps whatever steps it
        already completed, marked ``partial`` and counted in ``repeats_partial``
        rather than in ``repeat_done``; nothing measured is dropped. The step that
        was actually running leaves a folder with no ``record.json``, which reindex
        already skips as an incomplete run.

        ``on_progress(event) -> str | None`` receives, in order per repeat:
        ``cadence_wait`` (only when the period actually sleeps), ``repeat_start``,
        one ``step_done`` per step, then ``repeat_done``. This method itself never
        prints — the library stays renderer-free and the CLI does the rendering
        (``scqo.cli._campaign.progress_lines``). A notebook can pass its own::

            sess.run_campaign(plan, on_progress=lambda e: print(e["kind"]))

        Returning ``"stop"`` ends the campaign, and is honoured **only** on
        ``repeat_done``: stopping mid-repeat would leave a half-walked bundle
        whose quantities no longer share a drift epoch, which is exactly the
        invariant the interleaved ordering exists to protect.

        ``monotonic`` and ``sleep`` are a TEST SEAM, not an extension point. They
        exist because this method is the only place in ``Session`` that reads a
        clock for anything but a timestamp, and because a test could otherwise
        only reach the cadence gate by really waiting or by monkeypatching the
        stdlib for the whole process — both of which have produced failures that
        were about the machine's speed rather than the code (v3.6.0 and v3.8.0
        each repaired one). A fake that advances virtual time on ``sleep`` makes
        the gate, the ``max_duration_s`` budget and the overrun branch
        deterministic. Production callers must leave both alone; the defaults are
        bound once at definition, so passing anything else changes what "now"
        means for the whole campaign.
