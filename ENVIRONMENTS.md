# Which Python environment — the one authority for all four repos

Four environments live on a lab machine and they are **not** interchangeable. Substituting one
for another is silent in three of the four directions: the suite passes, and it tested something
else.

This file is the single source of truth. The siblings (`scqat`, `scqo-qblox`, `scqo-qm`) carry a
short stub pointing here rather than their own copy, for the reason
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) already gives about itself — a release is a combo across the
repos, and separate copies disagree within one cycle.

## The rule

**The environment is a property of the REPO whose tests you are running, not of the machine you
are on.** Each repo has exactly one canonical test command; the table below is the whole answer.
Every *other* environment exists to run **experiments**, not tests.

Two families, both load-bearing, neither mergeable into the other:

- **Repo-local `<repo>/.venv`** — uv's project environment, created and kept in step by `uv run`
  from that repo's tracked `uv.lock`. This is where **tests** run for SCQO, scqat and
  scqo-qblox. It is disposable: delete it and the next `uv run` rebuilds it.
- **Shared `<parent>/.venv-view`, `.venv-qblox`, `.venv-qm`** — hand-built per
  [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §1 with `uv venv` + `uv pip install -e`. This is where
  **measurements** run (`scqo run`, `scqo state`), and for **scqo-qm it is also where tests run**,
  because that repo's pin authority is `requirements-qm.lock.txt`, not `pyproject.toml`.

There is **no `<parent>/.venv`**. If a document tells you to create one, it is stale — say so.

## One vendor version, every environment

A vendor library must be at the **same version in every environment that can compile a schedule
or a program**, repo-local and shared alike.

On **2026-07-26** `scqo-qblox/.venv` held `qblox-scheduler` **b4** while the lab's `.venv-qblox`
held **b6**. The two versions *disagree about whether a schedule is legal*: `readout_frequency`
compiled clean offline and **died on the hardware**. Both are `1.0.0b6` now (with
`qblox_instruments` 1.3.0), pinned in three places that move together — scqo-qblox's
`pyproject.toml` floor, its `uv.lock`, and the `uv pip install "qblox-scheduler==1.0.0b6"` line
in INSTALL.md §1.

The consequence is scqo-qblox's **mandatory second test run** (see the table). Compiling in one
environment proves nothing about the other.

The QM side has the same shape with a different mechanism: its stack is pinned by
`scqo-qm/requirements-qm.lock.txt` at Python 3.11, and there is only ONE environment for it —
which is exactly why `uv run` is forbidden there. It would create a second one, resolved from a
different file.

## Per repo

| repo | run the tests with | which env that is | why not another |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SCQO** | targeted: `uv run pytest tests/test_model_experiments.py -k <stem> -q`<br>full: `uv run --extra viewer pytest -q` | `SCQO/.venv` — uv's project env from `SCQO/uv.lock`: `scqo` + `scqat` editable from `../scqat`, `pytest`, `httpx`. **No driver.** | The suite must be **driver-free**. `experiments/__init__.py` keeps the LAST registration (`_REGISTRY[cls.name] = cls`), so a driver's `@register`ed subclass replaces the core class under the same name: in `.venv-qm` / `.venv-qblox`, `session.run("single_shot_readout", …)` exercises the *driver's* `update()` and passes. `tests/test_cli_backends.py` already `skipif`s a test when a driver is present. |
| **scqat** | `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_<name>_estimator.py -q` | `scqat/.venv` | **`--extra dev` is mandatory** — `pytest` is in `[project.optional-dependencies]`, not `[dependency-groups]`, and uv installs only the latter by default; bare `uv run pytest` dies with `Failed to spawn: pytest`. scqat needs no sibling to test itself: it is the base of the import arrow. |
| **scqo-qblox** | `uv run pytest tests/ -q`<br>**then** `<parent>/.venv-qblox/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q` | `scqo-qblox/.venv`, then the shared `.venv-qblox` | Plain `uv run` is right here — `scqo` is a hard dependency so uv's sync keeps it, and `uv.lock` carries `qblox-scheduler==1.0.0b6` plus `scqat` editable from `../scqat`. The **second** run is the vendor-version rule above. It is not a formality: it is the check 2026-07-26 did not have. |
| **scqo-qm** | `<parent>/.venv-qm/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q` | the shared `.venv-qm` (Python **3.11**, from `requirements-qm.lock.txt` + editable `scqat` / `SCQO` / `scqo-qm`) | **`uv run` is forbidden here.** Its sync rebuilds the env from `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, displacing `requirements-qm.lock.txt` — the pin authority for the whole `qm-qua → quam → qualibrate` stack, which is why that lockfile exists. **There is no repo-local venv for this repo**; a `scqo-qm/.venv` on disk is residue of a stray `uv run` and cannot run the suite (it holds no `qm`, no `quam`, no `qualibrate`, no `scqat`). `uv run --no-sync` is meaningful only with `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` pointed at `.venv-qm`; calling the interpreter by path is unambiguous. |

**`0 collected`, or ANY skip, is an alarm — not a pass.** A correctly configured SCQO full run
reports **zero skipped** (no count is quoted here on purpose — see CLAUDE.md on how test counts
rot). Without `--extra viewer` the run is silently 67 tests short: the viewer stack is a root
*extra*, `uv run` installs only the default dependency-group, and `tests/test_viewer.py`'s
module-level `pytest.importorskip("fastapi")` takes 54 tests with it while
`tests/test_lab_report.py`'s gates take 13 more. Measured 2026-09-04 in a clean project env
(917 against 984); a machine that once ran `uv pip install -e ".[viewer]"` has them lying around
and will NOT reproduce it, which is exactly what kept this hidden.

## The shared environments (operators)

Three of them, named by role, each with its own shell prompt. **One rule: activate `view` for
everything except actually running a measurement.** Contents, prompts, and the build commands are
in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §1 — not repeated here, so they cannot drift. Students never run
tests.

## CI is a fourth arrangement, deliberately

SCQO's, scqat's and scqo-qblox's workflows install with bare `pip install -e` into
`actions/setup-python` — no uv, no lockfile. On purpose: CI proves the **sibling layout installs
from a cold registry**, which a lockfile would hide. It is not a recipe to copy locally, and a
green CI does not prove your local environment is right.

`scqo-qm` has **no CI at all** — its git-sourced dependencies and pinned 3.11 lockfile make it
impractical — so a pasted local result is the only evidence a reviewer gets. Always say which
interpreter produced it.

## Editable installs freeze — but only the hand-built kind

`uv pip install -e` records the version **at install time**, so after a checkout or a pull the
metadata describes a tree that is no longer there. That is the single most common source of
"impossible" behaviour in this stack, and the fix is to re-run the §1 lines for `.venv-view` /
`.venv-qblox` / `.venv-qm`.

**`uv run` does not have this problem** — it re-syncs from the lockfile on every invocation.
Conflating the two families on this point is one of the confusions this file exists to end.
Check either with `python scripts/check_contribution.py` (section 2), which compares the tree's
version against the installed metadata and prints the interpreter that answered.

## Python versions

All four repos target **`>=3.10,<3.13`**. The lab standard is **3.12.13**, except `.venv-qm` at
**3.11.15**, because `requirements-qm.lock.txt` is a 3.11 lockfile. CI covers 3.12 and 3.10.
Nothing in the stack is tested above 3.12.
