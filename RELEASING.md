# Cutting a release (manager checklist)

A release is a **combo**: one tag name across the scqo-versioned repos plus a pinned
scqat tag, recorded in [RELEASES.toml](RELEASES.toml). Born from the v0.4.0 lesson:
tagging only SCQO left the server's checkout-by-tag procedure unable to bring the
drivers forward, and nobody could tell which repo states belonged together.

## The version rule

One combo number covers the scqo-versioned repos; scqat versions independently on
its own line under the SAME rule, tied to the combo by the coupling floors.

**A fragment's `kind` and the release digit are two separate judgments**, and
conflating them is the standing mistake: `kind` says what the change does to
consumers (and so what the notes owe them), the digit says how far the release
number moves. **Digit = max severity over the consumed fragments:**

- **x+1 (MAJOR) — ONLY when stored data or the server structure breaks.** The
  run-folder/dataset layout, a state-file or history-DB schema, the datastore
  index contract, the structure of `config.toml`/`user.toml`/`cooldowns.toml`, or
  the install/deployment shape. The test is what the upgrade COSTS: a major is
  where an operator migrates DATA or a MACHINE, not where they edit a file. Both
  majors so far pass it — v2.0.0 moved change history off JSONL into per-context
  `history.sqlite`, and v3.0.0 renamed `f_r0_hz`/`f_r_hz` inside every
  `physical.json` and `design.toml`.
- **y+1 (MINOR) — every experiment-level change**, whether its fragment is
  `additive` or `breaking`. New experiments, and equally a renamed registered
  experiment, renamed Parameters fields, or renamed catalog fields/knobs: the
  operator fixes those by editing `parameters.toml`, a campaign plan or a script,
  and nothing stored has to move. The migration is still real and still MUST be in
  the notes — that obligation rides the `kind`, never the digit. v3.3.0 is the
  worked example (a `breaking` fragment, cut minor).
- **z+1 (PATCH)** — a fix-only cut.

v1.0.0 was declared deliberately 2026-08-09 with the v1 driver restructure; the
0.x rule (breaking/additive → y+1, all-fix → z+1) is history for the combo line,
and still governs scqat's own 0.x line.

Fragment `kind`, which drives the notes and the coupling floors:

- **Breaking** is judged against OUR consumers, not just the Python API: an
  existing user artifact (script, campaign plan, parameters.toml,
  config.toml/user.toml, stored state) must change to keep working. That includes
  renamed/removed registered experiment names or Parameters fields, renamed
  catalog fields/knobs, state-file `schema` number bumps, config key changes, and
  contract/dataset changes that break re-analysis of old runs. Only the last
  three — state-file `schema` bumps, config key changes and contract/dataset
  changes — reach the MAJOR digit; the two rename groups are minors.
- **Fix** = behavior-preserving repair or cosmetic change (figure labels,
  annotations, docs). Repairing a BROKEN fit is still `fix` even though numbers
  change — its notes must say re-analysis refreshes old artifacts (run folders
  stay immutable). Changing a WORKING estimator's numbers is a behavior change =
  `additive`.
- **Breaking ⇒ the RELEASES.toml notes line carries the upgrade action**,
  aggregated from the fragments' UPGRADE REQUIRES phrasing (v0.24.0's notes are
  the model). No shims or aliases ship (house rule) — the notes ARE the migration
  path.

0. **Read the pending-feature ledger `RELEASES.d/`** — ONE fragment file per
   feature (format + the multi-agent rules in `RELEASES.d/README.md`): per-repo
   commits, breaking/additive kind, lockstep couplings (the scqat floor comes from
   these) and validation status. Cross-check against `git log <last-tag>..HEAD` per
   repo (a fragment may be missing — the ledger is maintained by whoever lands each
   feature). Build the new `[vX-Y-Z]` block FROM the fragments, then `git rm` the
   consumed fragments in the same commit.

1. **CI green** on SCQO main (3 OS). Driver suites green in the environment
   [ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md) names for each — scqo-qblox in BOTH its `uv run` env
   and `.venv-qblox`, scqo-qm in `.venv-qm`. SCQO's own full suite needs `--extra viewer`
   or it silently collects 917 of 984.
2. **Version metadata matches the tag**: bump `version` in SCQO's `pyproject.toml` to
   the release number (the `scqo --version` a user sees). scqat manages its own
   version line with the same rule (its release checklist).
3. **Tag the three scqo-versioned repos with the SAME name** — SCQO, scqo-qblox,
   scqo-qm — at their release commits (unchanged repos get a no-change re-tag;
   annotate it as such). `scqo-contrib` is **retired** as of v3.2.0 and is no longer
   tagged; `RELEASES.toml` keeps its pin line for history only:

   ```powershell
   git tag vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z: <one-liner>"; git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Record the combo in RELEASES.toml**: all three tags + the scqat pin + a notes line
   that names any REQUIRED upgrade action (e.g. v0.4.0's editable reinstalls).
5. **Push everything**; verify with `git ls-remote --tags origin` per repo.
6. **Server upgrade — NOT part of cutting a release, and not tracked as owed.** The lab
   server is upgraded when its operator decides to, and they will ask. Do not add a
   "SERVER UPGRADE" line to the `RELEASES.toml` notes, do not carry "the server is N cuts
   behind" forward from one block to the next, and do not list it as outstanding work in a
   status report (standing instruction, restated 2026-09-04). Anything an upgrade needs
   belongs in **UPGRADE REQUIRES** anyway, which is written for whoever runs it, whenever
   they run it. When asked, the procedure is INSTALL §5: `git fetch --tags && git checkout
   vX.Y.Z` in the three repos (+ scqat at its pinned tag), re-run the §1
   `uv pip install -e` lines when the notes say so, restart the viewer, then `scqo doctor`
   from a non-installer account.

Never move a pushed tag. A fix after tagging = a new patch release (this is how
v0.4.1 exists).
