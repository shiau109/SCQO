"""The estimator binding is 1:1 in BOTH directions — enforced, with the backlog visible.

An estimator is keyed by a READING (a dataset shape AND the model fitted to it), so a
binding is a claim that this model describes this signal. Two experiments binding one
estimator assert the same physics; if they really do, they are one experiment. The rule and
its decision procedure live in `CLAUDE.md` → *The estimator binding*.

The tree does not conform yet, and pretending otherwise would make the rule folklore. So
the exceptions are listed here with their migrations, and the test fails **in both
directions**: a new violation that is not listed fails, and a listed violation that has
been fixed fails until its entry is deleted. The lists can only shrink — never add to them.
