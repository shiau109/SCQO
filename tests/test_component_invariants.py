"""Invariants the component-model cutover must NOT break (insurance, written first).

(a) ``result.fit`` is keyed by RUN TARGET names — viewer trends read the index's
    fit JSON at ``$.{target}.{quantity}`` (datastore.fit_trend), so re-homing
    store fields to satellite components (q1_res, q1_ro) must never re-key the
    fit dicts. Cross-component update() writes go to satellite VIEWS; the fit
    stays on the target.
(b) OLD run records (written before the targets rename, carrying ``"qubits"``)
    must stay findable after reindex — run folders are truth and are never
    fresh-started.
