"""Index at scale + under concurrency: the two questions a shared index must answer.

1. Speed: 100k runs on one sample must not slow that sample's (or any neighbor's)
   queries — device-scoped pages walk the composite index and read only LIMIT rows.
2. Safety: two same-PC sessions (two students, two samples) writing simultaneously
   must never fail or lose rows — WAL + busy retry + short-lived connections.

Rows are inserted directly into the real schema (no run folders) so 100k rows cost
seconds, not hours; the query path exercised is exactly production ``find_runs``.
