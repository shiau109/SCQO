"""Preflight for a contribution to the scqo stack. Read-only; paste the output in your PR.

Documentation is best-effort - every coding agent loads instruction files differently,
and some not at all. This script is the part that does not depend on anyone having read
anything. It checks the four things that actually go wrong:

  1. the SIBLING LAYOUT, because `pyproject.toml` resolves scqat as `../scqat` and each
     driver resolves scqo as `../SCQO`, so a renamed or nested folder breaks the install;
  2. EDITABLE-INSTALL FRESHNESS - the recorded version freezes at install time, so after
     a branch switch the metadata describes a tree that is no longer there;
  3. BRANCH PAIRING - CI pairs your repos by branch NAME, so a mismatch means CI tested
     your change against upstream and its green tick proved nothing;
  4. whether you are about to commit a release-ledger fragment, which contributors
     should draft in the PR body instead;
  5. WHICH ENVIRONMENT - the stack has two families for real reasons, and substituting
     one for another is silent three ways out of four (SCQO/ENVIRONMENTS.md).

    python scripts/check_contribution.py

Exit code is 0 when nothing is wrong, 1 when something needs attention.
