# SCQO installation & verification

One-time setup per machine: build the Python environment, write the lab config, and
verify the stack — first offline, then against your instrument's real config files.
Done once (usually by the lab manager); students then follow [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).

The stack is cross-platform: the full test suite runs on **Windows, macOS and Linux**
in CI on every push (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`). Windows commands are shown first;
macOS/Linux equivalents follow where they differ.

## 1. The Python environments

**Policy: every environment is a plain venv managed by `uv`.** Conda is retired: an
audit (2026-07-05) showed the lab's conda envs used conda only as a Python installer
(all 180+ scientific/vendor packages came from pip) — uv does that job faster, with
lockfiles, and without licensing questions.

Three environments, named by **role**, each with its own shell prompt so you always
see which one is active. **The one rule: activate `view` for everything except
actually running a measurement.**

| venv | prompt | contents | activate when you… |
|---|---|---|---|
| `D:\github\.venv-view` | `(view)` | scqo `[viewer]` + scqat + datasette + pytest — **no instrument libraries** | look at data (the common case): run-viewer, SQL browser, `find_runs.py`, `tag_run.py`. Works identically on an analysis-only laptop/Mac. |
| `D:\github\.venv-qblox` | `(qblox)` | the view stack + LCHQBDriver + `qblox-scheduler==1.0.0b4` (hardware-proven) + scqo-contrib | measure on the Qblox cluster: `run_experiment.py`, `calibrate.py`, `device.py` |
| `D:\github\.venv-qm` | `(.venv-qm)` | pinned QM stack, py3.11 (`LCHQMDriver\requirements-qm.lock.txt`) + scqo/scqat/LCHQMDriver editables | measure on the OPX1000 or use qualibrate — `qm.bat` activates it for you |

All three import scqo/scqat from the same editable checkouts, so they never drift on
the neutral layer. `uv` creates standard venvs and downloads Python itself if the
machine has none.

The repos must sit next to each other in one folder (`SCQO` and `scqat`
as siblings) — on the lab PC that folder is `D:\github`; on your own Mac clone them:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/github && cd ~/github
git clone https://github.com/shiau109/SCQO.git
git clone https://github.com/shiau109/scqat.git
git clone https://github.com/shiau109/LCHQBDriver.git    # only if this machine drives the Qblox cluster
git clone https://github.com/shiau109/LCHQMDriver.git    # only if this machine drives the OPX1000
git clone https://github.com/shiau109/scqo-contrib.git   # optional: the Tier-2 sandbox
```

(A repo that is still **private** answers `Repository not found` when the active
GitHub credential cannot see it — sign in with an account that has access.)

**Windows: install uv once per machine** (no admin needed):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer updates the registry PATH, so only **new** terminals see `uv`; in the
same shell call it by full path — `& "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\uv.exe" venv ...`.

**Server reached via SSH (multi-account)?** Install the Pythons to a shared folder
and create the venvs with the EXPLICIT patch-directory interpreter, not a bare
version number:

```powershell
$env:UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR = 'D:\uv\python'   # shared — NOT inside one user's profile
uv python install 3.12 3.11
uv venv .venv-view --python D:\uv\python\cpython-3.12.13-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe --prompt view
```

Two reasons, both learned on the lab server (2026-07-06): (a) uv's default Python
location is inside the installing user's profile — every other account (the SSH
students) gets `uv trampoline failed to spawn Python child process`; (b) a bare
`--python 3.12` bakes uv's minor-version *junction* path into the venv trampoline,
and SSH logon sessions can fail to traverse those junctions — same error over SSH
while the console works. The explicit patch path sidesteps both and pins the Python
patch level, which is what a tagged-release server wants anyway (section 6 has the
symptom table).

**Windows (PowerShell)** — on the lab PC all three envs already exist under `D:\github`:

```powershell
cd D:\github

# view — data browsing, no instrument (the daily default)
uv venv .venv-view --python 3.12 --prompt view
uv pip install --python .venv-view\Scripts\python.exe -e ".\SCQO[viewer]" -e .\scqat datasette pytest httpx

# qblox — measurement env for the Qblox cluster
uv venv .venv-qblox --python 3.12 --prompt qblox
uv pip install --python .venv-qblox\Scripts\python.exe -e ".\SCQO[viewer]" -e .\scqat -e .\LCHQBDriver -e .\scqo-contrib datasette pytest httpx
uv pip install --python .venv-qblox\Scripts\python.exe "qblox-scheduler==1.0.0b4"   # exact hardware-proven build (see note)

# qm — measurement env for the OPX1000 (pinned, py3.11)
uv venv .venv-qm --python 3.11
uv pip install --python .venv-qm\Scripts\python.exe -r .\LCHQMDriver\requirements-qm.lock.txt
uv pip install --python .venv-qm\Scripts\python.exe -e .\scqat -e .\SCQO -e .\LCHQMDriver --no-deps

.venv-view\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # daily default — prompt shows (view)
```

(`[viewer]` pulls the run-viewer's web extras — fastapi/uvicorn/jinja2/python-multipart —
for `python -m scqo.viewer`; `datasette` powers the SQL browser `python -m scqo.browse`.
**qblox-scheduler pin:** LCHQBDriver's pyproject floors it at `>=1.0.0b4` because PyPI's
only non-prerelease is an empty 0.0.0 placeholder that fails to build; the explicit
`==1.0.0b4` line then holds the env at the exact build proven on the cluster — bump it
deliberately after re-validation, never by accidental rebuild.)

**macOS / Linux** — install uv once with `brew install uv` (or
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`). An analysis-only machine needs
**just the view env**:

```bash
cd ~/github
uv venv .venv-view --python 3.12 --prompt view
uv pip install --python .venv-view/bin/python -e "./SCQO[viewer]" -e ./scqat datasette pytest httpx
source .venv-view/bin/activate
```

(Add the qblox env — same lines as Windows with `/bin/python` paths — only if the
machine actually drives a cluster; finding/loading/viewing saved data never needs it.)

## 2. The lab config: `~\.scqo\config.toml`

This one small file tells every script where data goes, which device you are on,
and which backend runs. Create it at `~\.scqo\config.toml` (Windows:
`C:\Users\<you>\.scqo\config.toml`; macOS: `/Users/<you>/.scqo/config.toml`).
Save it as **UTF-8 without BOM** — Python's `tomllib` rejects UTF-16 and BOM'd
files. Normal editors do this by default; PowerShell 5.1's `Out-File`/`Set-Content
-Encoding UTF8` writes a BOM, so when scripting the file use
`[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $text)` instead.

**Backend modes** — pick how real the setup is:

| `backend =` | device tree | data | writebacks persist to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"simulated"` | built-in demo qubits | synthetic | scqo state file (use `state_sync="push"`) |
| `"qblox_sim"` | **your REAL dut config** (working copy) | synthetic | the working `dut_config.json` |
| `"qm_sim"` | **your REAL QUAM state** (working copy) | synthetic | the working `state.json` |
| `"qblox"` / `"qm"` | real instrument | real | vendor config (QM: keep `state_sync="pull"`) |

The `*_sim` modes are the **virtual twin**: real qubit names and calibration values as
starting points, no hardware needed — the recommended practice mode for students. Set
them up once by copying your vendor config into a working folder (originals stay
pristine), e.g. `copy dut_config_AS_QRC.json D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\qblox_state\dut_config.json`.

Windows (virtual-twin example):

```toml
[lab]
data_root   = 'D:\qpu_data'                          # all measurement data lands here
device_name = "SQ_demo"                              # the SAMPLE (chip) name — never the instrument
state_path  = 'D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\scqo_state.json'  # change history (provenance)
backend     = "qblox_sim"                            # REAL device tree, synthetic data
default_tags = ["cooldown1"]                         # stamped on EVERY run; edit each cooldown

[qblox]
config_dir = 'D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\qblox_state'       # working copy of dut_config.json (+ hw_config.json for "qblox")

# QM virtual twin instead: backend = "qm_sim" plus
# [qm]
# state_dir = 'D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\qm_state'         # working copy of state.json + wiring.json
```

**Two instruments, two samples, one PC:** each vendor table may override
`device_name`/`state_path` with the sample mounted on *that* instrument — switching
`backend` then switches the sample automatically, so runs can never land under the
wrong device:

```toml
[qblox]
config_dir  = 'D:\qpu_data\chipA\qblox_state'
device_name = "chipA"
state_path  = 'D:\qpu_data\chipA\scqo_state.json'

[qm]
state_dir   = 'D:\qpu_data\chipB\qm_state'
device_name = "chipB"
state_path  = 'D:\qpu_data\chipB\scqo_state.json'
```

**QUAM state authority (QM):** `[qm] state_dir` names THE state a session uses in
**both** `qm_sim` and real `qm` modes (since v0.1.2 — before that, real mode silently
resolved through `~/.qualibrate`, the hidden second authority that broke the server's
first real run). A machine measuring the real instrument points it at the LIVE state
folder; a tier-2 dev machine doing a real prove-out points it at a **fresh copy of
the server's live state** (scp it over first) — `state_sync = "pull"` keeps
writebacks inside the copy, so the canonical state is never touched.

Optionally describe each sample in `<data_root>\devices.toml` (one table per chip:
description, design values, where it is mounted — instrument-independent facts only);
the viewer's Device page shows the matching card. All samples share ONE `data_root`
and ONE index — filter with `--device` / the viewer's device dropdown.

**Moving a sample to the other instrument** (e.g. chipA from Qblox to the OPX1000)
needs **no data action at all** — the folder, index, history and trends follow the
sample name; runs before/after the move stay distinguishable by their `backend`.
The operator's checklist:

1. Config: carry the sample in the NEW instrument's table (`[qm] device_name =
   "chipA"` + its `state_path`), set `backend = "qm"`; update `mounted_on` in
   `devices.toml`; new fridge insert = new cooldown → edit `default_tags`.
2. Build the new vendor config as usual (wiring/attenuation are new-fridge facts).
   **Seed the frequencies from the sample's last known values**: open the viewer's
   Device page (it reads saved snapshots, so it works after the old instrument is
   disconnected) and copy `readout_freq` / `drive_freq` per qubit — these are sample
   properties and transfer well.
3. Do **NOT** transfer `pi_amp` / `readout_amp` — they encode the setup (line
   attenuation, output gain). Re-derive them with the standard bring-up:
   `python scripts\calibrate.py` on the new instrument.
4. Keep **qubit names identical across instruments** — `q1` must mean the same
   physical qubit in `dut_config.json` AND in the QUAM `state.json`. Names belong to
   the sample; different names would split its trends and history.

macOS / Linux (`~` is expanded for you; plain-simulated example):

```toml
[lab]
data_root   = "~/qpu_data"
device_name = "SQ_demo"
state_path  = "~/qpu_data/SQ_demo/scqo_state.json"
backend     = "simulated"
state_sync  = "push"
default_tags = ["cooldown1"]
```

State persistence: in the `*_sim` twin modes the working vendor config **is** the
device state — it updates on every successful run, so calibrations persist across
invocations with the default `state_sync = "pull"`. Only the plain `"simulated"` demo
needs `state_sync = "push"` to persist, since its device is created fresh in memory
each time. On QM control PCs `"pull"` is mandatory — see LCHQMDriver's CLAUDE.md.

Other notes:
- A temporary alternative config can be selected per shell
  (PowerShell: `$env:SCQO_CONFIG = "path\to\other.toml"`; bash/zsh:
  `export SCQO_CONFIG=path/to/other.toml`) or per command with `--config`.
- A mistyped `$SCQO_CONFIG` **fails loudly** — it will not silently run unsaved.

### Standing parameter defaults: `~\.scqo\parameters.toml`

A second, optional TOML file holds your **semi-permanent experiment settings** — the
knobs you would otherwise retype on every run. One top-level table per experiment
(names as shown by `run_experiment.py`'s catalog listing); precedence is always
**code defaults < this file < whatever you pass on the CLI / in the caller dict**,
so the command line keeps the last word:

```toml
# Standing per-experiment defaults. Precedence: code defaults < this file < CLI/caller.
[resonator_spectroscopy]
frequency_span_hz = 15e6
num_points = 201

[single_shot_readout]
qubits = ["q1"]          # even required knobs may get a standing default
```

- With the file in place, a project's daily commands shrink to
  `python scripts\run_experiment.py resonator_spectroscopy` — and
  `calibrate.py` runs every sequence step with these effective defaults too.
- `--help` on any launcher marks file-sourced values, e.g. `default=15e6 [parameters.toml]`.
- Working on several projects? Point `parameters_file` in `[lab]` at a different
  file to swap the whole set. Two samples on two instruments? Each vendor table
  (`[qblox]`/`[qm]`) may override `parameters_file` with that sample's own set —
  exactly like `device_name`/`state_path` above.
- Same encoding rule as the config: **UTF-8 without BOM**.
- Failure rules match the config's: a *named* `parameters_file` that is missing, or a
  file that does not parse, **fails loudly** (this file changes what gets measured);
  only the implicit `~\.scqo\parameters.toml` may be absent — code defaults apply. A
  typo'd knob NAME inside a table is caught when that experiment runs, as a structured
  failure naming the key and this file. Tables for experiments not installed in the
  current env (e.g. contrib) load silently and are simply unused.
- Every run still records its **fully-resolved** parameters in `parameters.json`, so
  saved runs stay reproducible no matter which tier a value came from.
- TOML has no `null`: a knob whose code default is `None` (e.g. `readout_amplitude`)
  can be *set* here but not reset to `None` — override per run with
  `--set readout_amplitude=null` instead.
- Not supported (by design): per-qubit defaults — parameters are per-run scalars
  shared by every qubit in the run's list.

### Per-user overlay: `~\.scqo\user.toml`

On a multi-account server with ONE machine-wide shared config (`SCQO_CONFIG`), each
account may keep a small personal overlay — flat keys, no tables:

```toml
backend = "qm"                    # which instrument I measure — the SAMPLE follows it
default_tags = ["projA"]          # appended to the shared tags, deduped
parameters_file = "~/my_params.toml"   # beats the vendor table and [lab]
```

Only these three keys are allowed — anything else (data_root, device_name,
state_path...) is machine wiring and fails loudly: a user cannot repoint where data
lands or which sample an instrument carries. The overlay applies only on top of a
FOUND base config, never to the built-in defaults. `$SCQO_USER_CONFIG` selects a
different overlay file, or disables the overlay with `none` (scripts/tests use this).
See which instruments you can select — and the exact line to write — with
`python scripts\devices.py` (touches no instrument).

### Registries: instruments, cooldown cycles, wiring

Three optional hand-edited TOML files complete the lab picture. The principle:
**every fact lives at the level that owns it** — and every run is stamped with its
full environment (cycle id + wiring era + operator + backend).

`<data_root>\instruments.toml` — one table per instrument (connection facts the
wiring mappings and `devices.toml`'s `mounted_on` reference; documentation only —
the vendor configs remain what actually drives hardware):

```toml
[cluster0]
kind = "qblox_cluster"
address = "192.168.0.2"
connection = "ethernet"
```

`<data_root>\<device>\cooldowns.toml` — the device's cycle registry: one table per
cooldown (packaging is FIXED per cycle — you cannot repackage cold), with dated FULL
wiring snapshots underneath. Add a new `[[<id>.mapping]]` block whenever ANY port
changes — a broken channel moving on the same instrument counts, and so does swapping
the whole instrument:

```toml
[cd8]
start = 2026-07-06
fridge = "BlueforsA"
packaging = "PCB v3, Al box"
# end = 2026-08-01                # absent = this cycle is ACTIVE

[[cd8.mapping]]
since = 2026-07-06
"q1.drive"   = "cluster0.module2.out0"
"q1.readout" = "cluster0.module6.in0"

[[cd8.mapping]]                    # same instrument, one dead channel — still a change
since = 2026-07-15
note = "module2 out0 dead"
"q1.drive"   = "cluster0.module3.out1"
"q1.readout" = "cluster0.module6.in0"
```

Manage cycles with `python scripts\cooldown.py` — run from a DRIVER repo
(`cd D:\github\LCHQBDriver` or `LCHQMDriver`; SCQO itself has no `scripts\`) —
(no args = validate + show; `start <id>` / `end` do safe minimal file edits;
mapping snapshots are hand-edited).
Every run is then auto-stamped with the active cycle and wiring era — query with
`find_runs.py --cooldown cd8`, filter in the viewer, and stop hand-editing a
cooldown tag into `default_tags`. Failure rules: `instruments.toml`/`devices.toml`
are display-only (a typo warns and is ignored); `cooldowns.toml` STAMPS RUNS, so a
broken file fails loudly at run start — before any instrument time is spent.

**Upgrading from v0.2.x or older (fresh-start policy):** existing data was declared
disposable — there is no migration. The index rebuilds itself (schema check); delete
`<device>\scqo_state.json` if present (it reseeds from the vendor config; history
starts fresh); old run folders may stay (reindex skips anything unreadable).

### Adding a new sample

One manual edit, two optional entries, everything else auto-creates. From a DRIVER
repo (`cd D:\github\LCHQBDriver` — the student scripts live there, not in SCQO):
`python scripts\sample.py new <name> --backend qblox --instrument cluster0` prints all
of it paste-ready and creates the data folder (it never edits shared files):

1. **Manual (manager)**: the shared config's vendor table (`[qblox]`/`[qm]`
   `device_name` + `state_path` — the sample follows that instrument), or `[lab]
   device_name` for simulated. Twin modes also need the vendor-config working copy.
2. **Optional registries**: a `devices.toml` entry (sample facts, `mounted_on`) and —
   once per *instrument*, not per sample — an `instruments.toml` entry.
3. **Automatic on first use**: `<data_root>\<name>\` run folders, `scqo_state.json`,
   the index row, viewer pages; `cooldowns.toml` via `cooldown.py start cd1 ...`
   (hand-add its `[[cd1.mapping]]` wiring snapshot). Verify with `devices.py`.

### Factory reset (make a machine "new" again)

To reinstall as if on a clean computer, delete the machine's scqo state — repos and
venvs may stay (they are code, not state):

**Dev PC:** close any running viewer/datasette, then delete your per-user files and
your scratch data root; unset the env vars if you ever set them:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.scqo"        # config/parameters/user toml
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force 'D:\local_test_data'            # your scratch data_root
Remove-Item Env:SCQO_CONFIG, Env:SCQO_USER_CONFIG -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Afterwards every script prints `# lab config: built-in defaults (simulated, nothing
saved)` — the new-machine state; continue with the Developer quickstart below.

**Lab server:** stop the viewer; delete the live data_root — **WARNING: the NAS
mirror propagates deletions on its next scheduled sync; copy anything you want to
keep OFF the NAS first** — then delete each account's `~\.scqo\` personal files.
Keep (or recreate) the machine-wide `SCQO_CONFIG` shared config file, `git fetch
--tags && git checkout <new tag>` in each repo, and per the fresh-start rule delete
`scqo_state.json` (it reseeds from the vendor configs). Re-seed the registries
(`instruments.toml`, `devices.toml`, per-device `cooldowns.toml`) before the first
measurement so runs are stamped from day one.

### Developer quickstart (local, no hardware)

The whole system on your own machine in six steps — a Tier-2/3 dev deployment with a
SCRATCH data root (dev machines track `main`, keep their own data, and never point
writes at the server's data — §5):

1. **Clone side-by-side** into one folder (§1 block: SCQO, scqat, and the driver
   repo(s) you develop against).
2. **Create the venvs** (§1 commands): `view` always; `qblox`/`qm` only if you drive
   that stack — **then activate the one the rest of this quickstart runs in**
   (`.venv-qblox` also contains the full view stack, so it covers the pytest, the
   scripts and the viewer below):

   ```powershell
   D:\github\.venv-qblox\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # macOS/Linux: source ~/github/.venv-qblox/bin/activate
   ```

   The venvs live NEXT TO the repos (in their parent folder), not inside them — a
   bare `.venv-qblox\Scripts\Activate.ps1` only works from that parent folder, and
   from inside a repo PowerShell shows a misleading "cannot load module" error.
   Every later `python ...` in this quickstart assumes the prompt shows `(qblox)`.
3. **Write `~\.scqo\config.toml`** — smallest working dev config (UTF-8 no BOM):

   ```toml
   [lab]
   data_root   = 'D:\qpu_data_dev'                          # scratch, yours alone
   device_name = "simdev"
   state_path  = 'D:\qpu_data_dev\simdev\scqo_state.json'
   backend     = "simulated"                                # demo qubits, synthetic data
   state_sync  = "push"                                     # simulated needs push to persist
   ```

   (Swap to the virtual twin — `qblox_sim`/`qm_sim` + a copied vendor config, table
   above — when you want your REAL device tree with synthetic data.)
4. **Optionally seed the registries** to exercise the full provenance chain:
   `D:\qpu_data_dev\instruments.toml`, `devices.toml`, and a first cycle — **the
   student scripts live in the DRIVER repos, not SCQO**, so:

   ```powershell
   cd D:\github\LCHQBDriver   # (or LCHQMDriver; scripts are mirrored)
   python scripts\cooldown.py start cd1 --fridge dev --packaging "sim"
   ```

   (then hand-add a `[[cd1.mapping]]` block). Every run is now stamped with cycle +
   wiring era + operator.
5. **Verify offline**: `cd D:\github\SCQO; python -m pytest -q` (§3 — all green, no
   instrument).
6. **First run + look at it** (back in the driver repo):

   ```powershell
   cd D:\github\LCHQBDriver
   python scripts\devices.py                                  # the menu — what can I select?
   python scripts\run_experiment.py resonator_spectroscopy    # first saved, stamped run
   python scripts\find_runs.py --limit 5
   python -m scqo.viewer                                      # -> http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

   From here, [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) is the daily manual.

## 3. Offline verification

The full test suite passes with no instrument attached (CI runs this exact suite on
Windows, macOS and Linux):

```bash
cd SCQO
python -m pytest -q        # expect: all passed (any env works; view is enough)
```

## 4. Self-test against your REAL device config (no hardware needed)

Before ever touching an instrument, verify the whole stack against your lab's actual
config files: each driver has a `check_real_config.py` that loads them, runs the full
pipeline with **simulated data over the real device tree** (read neutral fields → run
experiments → fit → write back → save in vendor format → reload and compare), and
prints PASS/FAIL. It works on a **temporary copy** — your originals are never opened
for writing, and nothing lands in your real data_root.

**Qblox** — needs the qblox env (`.venv-qblox\Scripts\Activate.ps1`). Point it at any
folder holding `dut_config*.json` + `hw_config*.json`:

```powershell
cd D:\github\LCHQBDriver
python scripts\check_real_config.py D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\QBLOX_config
```

**QM / OPX1000** — needs the qm env (`.venv-qm\Scripts\Activate.ps1`). Point it at
any folder holding `state.json` + `wiring.json`:

```powershell
cd D:\github\LCHQMDriver
python scripts\check_real_config.py D:\qpu_data\SQ_demo\QM_OPX1000_config
```

Expected output: 5 numbered steps, each OK, ending in
`PASS - scqo works against this real config`. A qubit whose state is uncalibrated
(fields `None`) is skipped automatically; on the Qblox device the coupler (`c12`) is
excluded by the `q*` default — pass `--qubits` to choose explicitly. Both lab configs
passed on 2026-07-04 (and this test caught three real integration bugs before any
hardware time was spent — that's its job).

## 5. Lab deployment — server + NAS + zero-install laptops

Target topology once the stack leaves the test bench:

```
instruments ── lab server (a normal PC; runs a TAGGED, stable version)

tier-1 laptop     browser -> http://<server>:8080 ; ssh <user>@<server> to measure
analysis laptop   view env (section 1) + own config.toml, data_root = the NAS copy
tier-2/3 dev PC   full local setup as in section 1 (sim/twin backends, contrib sandbox)
```

The rules that make this safe:

- **The live `index.sqlite` and run folders stay on the server's LOCAL disk** —
  SQLite's WAL mode does not work on network shares. The NAS holds a *mirror*
  refreshed by a scheduled task; the folders are the truth (that's what the backup
  protects) and the index rebuilds anywhere, so it doesn't even need mirroring.
- **One authoritative config per server** (instrument → sample mapping). With one
  login account per student, per-user `~\.scqo\config.toml` silently leaves every
  OTHER account on built-in defaults (simulated, unsaved!) — put the file at a shared
  path and select it machine-wide instead (admin, once):
  `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCQO_CONFIG','D:\github\scqo-config.toml','Machine')`.
  Personal configs exist only on analysis laptops and point `data_root` at the NAS
  copy — those machines read, never write. In the shared config, leave
  `parameters_file` **unset** so each account keeps its own standing defaults in
  `~\.scqo\parameters.toml` (section 2); setting it would pin ONE parameter set for
  every account — and a missing path fails loudly for all of them.
  **The sanctioned per-user layer on top of the shared config is `~\.scqo\user.toml`**
  (section 2): each account picks its own `backend` (= instrument = device),
  `default_tags` and `parameters_file` there — and nothing else.
- Simultaneous users are supported and tested (`tests/test_index_scale.py`), but
  **one measurement at a time per instrument** remains a social convention — the
  instruments themselves cannot run two programs at once.
- The server runs a **git tag** of all repos (first cut: `v0.1.0`, `git checkout
  v0.1.0` in each); dev machines track `main`. Update the server deliberately, after
  CI is green — never mid-cooldown on a whim. The update procedure:
  `git fetch --tags; git checkout <new tag>` in each repo, re-run section 3, restart
  the viewer (editable installs pick the new code up on restart).
- **Dev machines (tier 2/3) keep their OWN scratch `data_root`** (e.g.
  `D:\qpu_data_dev`) — never point writes at the server's data over the network
  (the SQLite rule). Tier-2 prove-out runs on real hardware execute from the dev
  machine (the instruments are network devices) into the dev data_root, and the
  manager reviews them there (`find_runs` / a local viewer) before promotion. The
  one-program-per-instrument convention spans machines: coordinate with whoever is
  measuring via the server.
- Every run records **who** ran it (`operator` = the SSH/Windows login) — filter with
  `find_runs.py --operator <name>` or the viewer's operator box.

One-time server setup (Windows 11, **admin** PowerShell — the only part of this
guide that needs elevation; everything else runs as a standard user):

```powershell
# SSH access for tier-1 measuring (macOS/Linux/Windows laptops all have ssh built in)
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
Set-Service sshd -StartupType Automatic; Start-Service sshd

# let LAN laptops reach the viewer — without this, localhost works but laptops get
# connection-refused (the first-bind firewall popup needs elevation anyway)
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "SCQO viewer 8080" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow `
  -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080
# add 8081 too if datasette (scqo.browse) should be reachable from laptops:
# New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "SCQO browse 8081" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8081

# make PowerShell the shell students land in (default is cmd.exe, where the
# venv Activate.ps1 scripts in TUTORIAL section 5 would not run)
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell `
  -Value "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -PropertyType String -Force

# one STANDARD (non-admin) account per student — the login becomes the run's
# recorded operator, so no shared accounts
net user <student> <initial-password> /add /fullname:"Student Name"

# nightly data mirror to the NAS (= the lab's backup policy; /MIR mirrors deletions too)
schtasks /Create /TN scqo-mirror /SC DAILY /ST 03:00 `
  /TR "robocopy D:\qpu_data \\NAS\qpu_data /MIR /R:2 /W:5 /LOG:D:\qpu_data\mirror.log"
```

Mirror notes: robocopy exit codes 1–7 all mean success, so the task's "Last Result"
of 0x1 is normal, not a failure. A Synology **Drive Client** sync task is an accepted
alternative to robocopy — but **only as one-way upload** ("Upload data to Synology
Drive Server only") with files kept fully local (on-demand placeholders off): a
two-way task would let NAS-side edits and deletions flow back INTO the live
`data_root`.

First start of the viewer (standard user — no elevation needed):

```powershell
# a FRESH data_root has no index yet; on v0.1.0 create it first (newer versions
# initialize an existing-but-empty folder automatically):
D:\github\.venv-view\Scripts\python.exe -m scqo D:\qpu_data      # prints: indexed 0 runs

# run it now…
D:\github\.venv-view\Scripts\python.exe -m scqo.viewer --host 0.0.0.0

# …and keep it running across logons with a Startup-folder script (no admin needed;
# runs while this account has a session — fine for an always-logged-on lab server)
@'
@echo off
start "" /min D:\github\.venv-view\Scripts\python.exe -m scqo.viewer --host 0.0.0.0
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding Ascii "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\scqo-viewer.cmd"
```

(Client side — what a student actually types from their laptop — is
[TUTORIAL.md §5](TUTORIAL.md); point new members there, not here.)

A student measuring from their own laptop, with nothing installed on it:

```
ssh <user>@<server>
D:\github\.venv-qblox\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python D:\github\LCHQBDriver\scripts\run_experiment.py resonator_spectroscopy --qubits q1
```

…then views the figures at `http://<server>:8080`.

## 6. Install troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: scqo` | no venv activated — Windows: `.venv-view\Scripts\Activate.ps1`; macOS/Linux: `source .venv-view/bin/activate` |
| viewer: `missing package: uvicorn` (or fastapi/jinja2) | **wrong venv activated** — the viewer lives in every section-1 env; check the prompt says `(view)`, `(qblox)` or `(.venv-qm)`, not something stale |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: lchqb` / `qblox_scheduler` from a run script | you're in the view env (by design it has no instrument libs) — activate `.venv-qblox` to measure |
| `lab config not found` | your `--config`/`$SCQO_CONFIG` path is wrong (intentional loud failure — better than silently unsaved) |
| `# lab config: built-in defaults ...` in the catalog header | no `~\.scqo\config.toml` yet: runs work but are **not saved** — do section 2. A personal `user.toml` does NOT rescue this: the overlay needs a base config |
| `... not allowed in a user overlay` | your `~\.scqo\user.toml` sets a machine-wiring key — only `backend` / `default_tags` / `parameters_file` are personal (section 2) |
| `invalid cooldown registry ...` at run start | `cooldowns.toml` is broken or has two open cycles — it stamps runs, so it fails BEFORE instrument time is spent; `cooldown.py` (no args) is the validator |
| self-test: `missing package: qblox_scheduler` | install the driver into this env (section 1, second install line) |
| `Repository not found` when cloning | the repo is (still) private and the active GitHub credential cannot see it — GitHub reports 404, not 403, to unauthorized users; sign in with an account that has access |
| self-test: `Unexpected attribute 'lo_mode'` / `'__package_versions__'` (or similar) | the vendor state file was written by a NEWER quam/vendor lib than this env's pin — delete the unknown null attributes from the **working copy** (originals untouched), or bump the lock deliberately after re-validation |
| viewer: `no index.sqlite under <data_root>` (v0.1.0) or `data_root does not exist` | fresh data_root: on v0.1.0 create the index first with `python -m scqo <data_root>`; newer versions initialize an existing folder automatically and only refuse a path that does not exist (typo guard) |
| viewer works at `http://localhost:8080` but LAN laptops get connection-refused | missing inbound firewall rule — run the `New-NetFirewallRule` line in section 5 (one-time, admin) |
| `uv trampoline failed to spawn Python child process` / `entity not found` — for every account except the installer | uv's Pythons live in the installing user's profile — reinstall to a shared dir (`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`) and recreate the venvs (section 1 SSH-server note) |
| same trampoline error, but ONLY in SSH sessions (console works) | the venv bakes uv's minor-version junction path in, and SSH logon sessions may not traverse junctions — recreate the venv with the explicit patch-dir interpreter (section 1 SSH-server note) |
| over SSH a student's catalog header says `built-in defaults` (runs not saved) | that account has no per-user config — set the machine-wide `SCQO_CONFIG` variable to the shared config (section 5) |

Setup done → hand the machine to the student and point them at
[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).
